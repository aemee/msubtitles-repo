1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:11,283 --> 00:00:13,417
There's this darkness.

3
00:00:13,418 --> 00:00:15,868
And it makes me feel sick.

4
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:18,556
I started to feel like
I was being choked.

5
00:00:18,557 --> 00:00:21,092
Very, very painful.

6
00:00:21,093 --> 00:00:24,062
I've been pushed down the steps.

7
00:00:24,063 --> 00:00:27,441
Some kind of physical abuse.

8
00:00:27,442 --> 00:00:29,834
They could have been dismembered.

9
00:00:29,835 --> 00:00:32,904
Does not want us here at all.

10
00:00:32,905 --> 00:00:35,615
It's just waiting to just tear us apart.

11
00:00:35,616 --> 00:00:41,136
There are secrets here that
some don't want discovered.

12
00:00:41,547 --> 00:00:44,046
They're being watched.

13
00:00:44,047 --> 00:00:46,785
My name is Amy Allan.

14
00:00:46,786 --> 00:00:48,987
This thing likes death.

15
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:50,722
I see dead people.

16
00:00:50,723 --> 00:00:52,356
This thing's, like, a monster.

17
00:00:52,357 --> 00:00:54,392
I speak to dead people.

18
00:00:54,393 --> 00:00:56,347
And he's pissed off now.

19
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,595
And they speak to me.

20
00:00:57,596 --> 00:00:59,261
His head was cracked.

21
00:00:59,262 --> 00:01:03,085
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

22
00:01:03,086 --> 00:01:04,445
This guy was murdered.

23
00:01:04,446 --> 00:01:05,917
I rely on my partner.

24
00:01:05,918 --> 00:01:09,107
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

25
00:01:09,108 --> 00:01:11,642
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

26
00:01:11,643 --> 00:01:15,280
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

27
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:16,414
You saw her?

28
00:01:16,415 --> 00:01:17,913
It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:17,914 --> 00:01:19,143
Why would you stay here?

30
00:01:19,144 --> 00:01:21,299
But Steve and I never speak...

31
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,194
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:23,195 --> 00:01:24,549
Until the very end.

33
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,290
Stop it.

34
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,526
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

35
00:01:28,527 --> 00:01:31,096
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

36
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:32,435
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:32,436 --> 00:01:37,176
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

38
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:57,856
Amy and I work the same case,
but from two separate angles.

39
00:01:57,857 --> 00:02:03,757
I gather witness testimony and uncover
secrets about the property's past.

40
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:07,084
While Amy communicates with the dead.

41
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,443
I'm in Buchanan, Virginia, about
30 minutes north of Roanoke.

42
00:02:10,444 --> 00:02:14,392
We've been called in by
a scared mom named Tysha.

43
00:02:14,393 --> 00:02:17,719
She tells me that whatever's on her
property is attacking her family,

44
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,965
and making everyone sick.

45
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:25,186
Hopefully, Amy and I can
get some answers for her.

46
00:02:32,203 --> 00:02:37,574
Before Amy arrives, I need to clear
the area of any leading information.

47
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:42,750
This house is filled with photos of a
young family, so I need to remove them all.

48
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:47,251
To avoid influencing
Amy during her walk.

49
00:03:01,164 --> 00:03:03,700
This place is really busy.

50
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:07,503
There's, like, a ton of [Bleep]
people around that are dead.

51
00:03:07,504 --> 00:03:08,913
Like, how many?

52
00:03:08,914 --> 00:03:14,254
I would count, like, 15
people that were walking by.

53
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,220
There's a lot of pain and despair here.

54
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:25,847
- Around the whole property.
- Okay.

55
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:33,372
I think something bad happened in there.

56
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,382
You know, Tysha, this
kitchen doesn't look lived in.

57
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:53,389
What's the story?

58
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,820
The activity in the house
just became outrageous,

59
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:58,912
and it just became too
much for our family.

60
00:03:58,913 --> 00:04:01,557
And we decided to build a
modular house three years ago.

61
00:04:01,558 --> 00:04:03,521
Is that the other structure
that I saw driving up?

62
00:04:03,522 --> 00:04:04,326
Yes, Sir.

63
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,491
Okay, so let me ask you a question, did
it get better when you moved over there?

64
00:04:07,492 --> 00:04:09,299
No, not at all.

65
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,122
So, give me an idea. What happened
while you were living in this house?

66
00:04:12,123 --> 00:04:15,787
We have everything from, like,
seeing apparitions and noises.

67
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:18,190
I've actually been choked before.

68
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,493
And I have nightmares all the time.

69
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,894
I cannot sleep.

70
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,097
On the phone, you said this
was affecting your health.

71
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,165
Yes, Sir.

72
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,886
The doctor said that he had
diagnosed me with a chronic

73
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:32,469
pain condition called
Fibromyalgia, and...

74
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,463
My pain was just so amplified,

75
00:04:34,464 --> 00:04:36,880
I was getting to where I
couldn't function at all.

76
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:39,644
Now, what about everybody else, are
they getting affected health-wise?

77
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:42,651
My two children... I have a
middle son that has Asperger's.

78
00:04:42,652 --> 00:04:45,088
- And my little one has autism.
- Oh, geez.

79
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:47,389
- All right. So you got your hands full.
- Yes.

80
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,994
Do you know any history
about this place?

81
00:04:48,995 --> 00:04:51,961
- We think it was built in 1847.
- Wow.

82
00:04:51,962 --> 00:04:55,378
My father-in-law lived here as
a bachelor for a very long time.

83
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,862
Now, is your husband's
father still alive?

84
00:04:57,863 --> 00:04:59,238
No, Sir. He passed away.

85
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:02,234
Okay. I'm sorry to hear
that. Did he ever mention...

86
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,118
Oh, yes.

87
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:04,089
- He did?
- Yes, Sir.

88
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,178
And what did he make of it?

89
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,739
I think he had a lot
of fear of things, too.

90
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,039
- He did?
- Yes, Sir.

91
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,523
Did you and your husband ever
consider moving off the property?

92
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:14,186
Financially, it would be
impossible for us to move.

93
00:05:14,187 --> 00:05:17,578
And I would never be able to do
that. It would break my heart.

94
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:19,067
Okay.

95
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:22,132
So, do you want to move back into
this house if we could help fix things?

96
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:23,993
Yes.

97
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,868
It seems like there were
a lot of people here.

98
00:05:29,869 --> 00:05:31,537
It's stressful.

99
00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:34,118
Very stressful.

100
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:46,051
That would not be good.

101
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:48,501
This place is crawling with dead people,

102
00:05:48,502 --> 00:05:52,312
who have the ability to affect
the living in horrific ways.

103
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:56,109
And I think it would make you terribly
ill, terribly ill to live here.

104
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,590
And it makes me feel sick.

105
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:05,120
What sort of stuff do you think
people would experience here?

106
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:07,106
Men's voices.

107
00:06:07,107 --> 00:06:09,207
Arguing.

108
00:06:09,876 --> 00:06:12,696
Seeing apparitions.

109
00:06:20,318 --> 00:06:23,018
Watch your step.

110
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,560
Geez, you weren't kidding.
This really is a dungeon.

111
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:31,227
This is probably the worst place.

112
00:06:31,228 --> 00:06:34,569
I just do not come down here.
I have terrible feelings...

113
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:38,230
Just dread, sadness, um, pain.

114
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:42,639
We were told, actually, that
slaves were kept down here, as well.

115
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,574
- Down here?
- Yes, Sir.

116
00:06:44,575 --> 00:06:47,773
- Have you ever seen anything down here?
- I've seen apparitions. Yes, Sir.

117
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:51,665
I've seen a man with, like, dark pants,

118
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:55,496
and he just kind of
walked across the floor...

119
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:58,341
And just disappeared.

120
00:06:58,342 --> 00:07:00,605
So, what are you actually
feeling right now?

121
00:07:00,606 --> 00:07:04,112
Uh, really nauseous, kind
of light-headed and dizzy.

122
00:07:04,113 --> 00:07:06,355
All right, you know what,
let's get the hell out of here.

123
00:07:06,356 --> 00:07:08,276
Okay.

124
00:07:21,504 --> 00:07:25,180
I see a lot of black men who
are dead, who are lined up,

125
00:07:25,181 --> 00:07:27,418
and somebody's throwing water on them.

126
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:31,979
Like, just throwing
water on their bodies.

127
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:37,583
In particular, there's a woman...

128
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:40,332
A black woman... who's...

129
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,598
Splashing the water on them.

130
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:46,319
Does not want us here at all.

131
00:07:48,572 --> 00:07:51,574
I don't think there are people
here who like white people.

132
00:07:51,575 --> 00:07:54,155
Like, get out.

133
00:07:56,647 --> 00:08:01,147
I just feel very
uncomfortable, and um...

134
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,364
Like...

135
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:05,701
I feel like she can do stuff.

136
00:08:05,702 --> 00:08:08,875
Could she be dangerous?

137
00:08:08,876 --> 00:08:11,276
I think so.

138
00:08:21,472 --> 00:08:23,639
So, what happened here?

139
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,242
This is the most active part
of the house that we have.

140
00:08:26,243 --> 00:08:29,345
One night, I was up here by
myself and I had fell asleep.

141
00:08:29,346 --> 00:08:33,183
The bed started vibrating, and then I
started to feel like I was being choked.

142
00:08:33,184 --> 00:08:35,575
It was like somebody was
sitting on top of my chest,

143
00:08:35,576 --> 00:08:38,120
pressing down with their two
thumbs on my adam's apple.

144
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:39,462
Was your husband in bed with you?

145
00:08:39,463 --> 00:08:41,653
- No. He was downstairs.
- Okay.

146
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,559
Well, anything else happen up here?

147
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,982
The scariest thing that
probably ever happened,

148
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,297
my son River... he was seven days old...

149
00:08:48,298 --> 00:08:51,721
And I actually fell down the steps...
it was like I was being pushed...

150
00:08:51,722 --> 00:08:53,569
And had him in my arms.

151
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,874
- Did he get hurt?
- No.

152
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:58,499
I just grabbed onto him as hard as I could
and just went down the steps on my back.

153
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,306
Did you get hurt?

154
00:08:59,307 --> 00:09:03,251
I had some bruises on my
bottom and my back. Yes, I did.

155
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:06,457
Now, you mentioned that some of
the stuff that's happened here

156
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,434
- is happening in the new house.
- Yes, Sir.

157
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:11,810
I'm gonna have to go and take a look
so you can show me where it's going on.

158
00:09:11,811 --> 00:09:14,991
- That's fine.
- Okay.

159
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:25,835
Now, Tysha, you mentioned you're in
this new house, what, three years?

160
00:09:25,836 --> 00:09:28,116
Yes. Going on three years, yes.

161
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:31,164
- And nothing's gotten better?
- No, nothing's gotten better.

162
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:36,712
Exactly the same thing that has went
on at the old house goes on over here.

163
00:09:36,713 --> 00:09:39,394
I still have the activity
of the pushing on the bed.

164
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:40,883
How heavy are we talking? Like...

165
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:43,856
Like a child would be jumping
from the head to the foot.

166
00:09:43,857 --> 00:09:49,317
- Like a small child jumping on the bed?
- Yeah, yeah.

167
00:09:51,628 --> 00:09:54,850
So, basically, all the [Bleep] people,

168
00:09:54,851 --> 00:10:00,011
that were over at the
other place came over here.

169
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:07,062
So, there's just, like,
this one kid who...

170
00:10:07,063 --> 00:10:09,523
Jumps around.

171
00:10:09,838 --> 00:10:13,558
And the other one follows him.

172
00:10:16,854 --> 00:10:19,755
And they kind of, like...

173
00:10:19,756 --> 00:10:22,222
They attempt to be seen.

174
00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:25,763
They're all over the house.

175
00:10:27,163 --> 00:10:30,163
So, what about the kids? Are
they experiencing anything, or...

176
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:35,517
Yes, my son Blaze. He keeps talking about
seeing the same little boy apparition.

177
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:37,139
Describe it to me.

178
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,384
Blaze said he has a white shirt
that buttons up with overalls.

179
00:10:41,385 --> 00:10:44,219
- Okay, have you seen it?
- I haven't seen the little boy.

180
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,023
It's pretty bad when, you know, you
think you're gonna build a new home

181
00:10:47,024 --> 00:10:52,924
and have, maybe, a new beginning, and
the same things are still going on.

182
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:58,845
A black woman hates me so much.

183
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,905
I'm in, like, a lot of pain here.

184
00:11:08,906 --> 00:11:11,173
Very, very painful.

185
00:11:11,174 --> 00:11:13,902
Very, very, very painful.

186
00:11:13,903 --> 00:11:15,511
What kind of pain?

187
00:11:15,512 --> 00:11:18,874
There was something about her head...

188
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:22,284
Her neck, and her back, and it's...

189
00:11:22,285 --> 00:11:24,974
Are you afraid of her?

190
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:29,475
I'm not really allowed to talk about it.

191
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:46,696
I'm in, like, a lot of pain here.

192
00:11:46,697 --> 00:11:48,681
What kind of pain?

193
00:11:48,682 --> 00:11:53,782
Something about her head,
her neck, and her back.

194
00:11:56,322 --> 00:11:58,239
Are you afraid of her?

195
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,038
I'm not really allowed to talk about it.

196
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:03,530
Why can't you talk about it?

197
00:12:03,531 --> 00:12:07,371
She has a way of preventing it.

198
00:12:08,678 --> 00:12:12,772
This black woman wants to communicate
to the living what's happened to her,

199
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,417
but she says she doesn't
trust me because I'm white.

200
00:12:15,418 --> 00:12:19,179
She also has this bizarre ability
I've never encountered before,

201
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,958
and it makes it impossible for me to
reveal details of her painful life.

202
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:26,839
I've never felt...

203
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,556
So much hatred.

204
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:41,599
So, Troy, I was talking to your wife.

205
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,478
She said that you grew
up on the property.

206
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:47,849
Yes, Sir. I've been on the property
pretty much since I came into the world.

207
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,208
Okay.

208
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:51,253
So, what have you experienced up here?

209
00:12:51,254 --> 00:12:56,741
Well, we put all new drywall in, and
we had it stacked up against the wall.

210
00:12:56,742 --> 00:13:01,002
And it started to shift over onto me.

211
00:13:01,202 --> 00:13:05,817
And I spun around to try and get
out from there, and I jumped...

212
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:10,572
And it all came down and smashed me down
and pinned this foot down to the ground.

213
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:12,458
That's a lot of weight.

214
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,743
And excruciating pain.

215
00:13:14,744 --> 00:13:17,379
And my son had walked in
right as that was going on.

216
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,381
That's why it was scaring me so much.

217
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,783
Could have killed me.
It could have killed him.

218
00:13:21,784 --> 00:13:24,138
So, this drywall couldn't
have got just pushed?

219
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:26,386
- Like, I mean...
- No. I mean, I'm a brick mason.

220
00:13:26,387 --> 00:13:29,891
- I deal around construction all the time.
- All right.

221
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,982
So, what else have you
experienced up here?

222
00:13:31,983 --> 00:13:35,588
I've been pushed down the steps.

223
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:37,799
Busted my arm up pretty good.

224
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,738
Tysha told me she got pushed
when she was holding the baby.

225
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:43,721
Tysha also got pushed,
same place, same step.

226
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:46,211
So, when you got pushed, did you
feel like somebody shoved you?

227
00:13:46,212 --> 00:13:50,011
Yeah, it did. Did feel like somebody
pushed right in the small of the back.

228
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:51,461
A good boom.

229
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:54,255
Well, I'm hoping that we can get
some answers to what's going on,

230
00:13:54,256 --> 00:13:56,250
what's causing it, and how to stop it.

231
00:13:56,251 --> 00:13:59,854
Yeah, before something bad
happens to one of the kids.

232
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:01,775
Okay.

233
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:08,141
The black lady...

234
00:14:08,142 --> 00:14:11,202
She says, basically...

235
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:14,758
That she's given warnings.

236
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:18,870
What kind of warnings has she given?

237
00:14:18,871 --> 00:14:23,061
Like, there's been some
kind of physical abuse.

238
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,942
Towards the adults.

239
00:14:26,481 --> 00:14:28,573
Like what?

240
00:14:28,574 --> 00:14:31,753
I feel like she... like, hitting...

241
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:35,474
Making them feel pain suddenly.

242
00:14:39,662 --> 00:14:43,622
She's not a very tolerant person.

243
00:14:50,873 --> 00:14:54,305
So, why'd you bring me in this room?

244
00:14:54,306 --> 00:14:58,340
I was relaxing on the sofa, and I
seen a big, big mist right here...

245
00:14:58,341 --> 00:15:00,415
A blackish-colored mist.

246
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:04,386
And I've seen that same
mist throughout the house.

247
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:06,546
And you've seen that
since you were a young man?

248
00:15:06,547 --> 00:15:08,905
I was 8 or 10 the first
time that I'd seen it.

249
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:10,587
And now you're seeing
it again as an adult?

250
00:15:10,588 --> 00:15:11,863
Yeah.

251
00:15:11,864 --> 00:15:15,527
You guys are the first people that
I've talked about this besides my wife.

252
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:16,390
Okay.

253
00:15:16,391 --> 00:15:20,216
Now, talking to Tysha,
she feels that her physical

254
00:15:20,217 --> 00:15:23,638
ailment was actually
brought on by the house.

255
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,836
- Do you believe that?
- Yeah.

256
00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:28,643
At first, it wasn't too bad.

257
00:15:28,644 --> 00:15:31,519
It seemed like the longer we were here,

258
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,110
her health just slowly
started going down, you know?

259
00:15:34,111 --> 00:15:37,790
I mean, you could look at her and see
she don't look like she's in bad shape,

260
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,540
but she's in a lot of pain.

261
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,642
Do you ever think about just moving?

262
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:45,871
That really, honestly, never
crossed my mind or anything

263
00:15:45,872 --> 00:15:49,900
because it's something
I hold dear to my heart.

264
00:15:49,901 --> 00:15:53,229
This place had been in
my family for so, so long.

265
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,212
And I've fought tooth and nail,
and Tysha has fought tooth and nail,

266
00:15:56,213 --> 00:15:58,093
to keep the property.

267
00:15:58,094 --> 00:16:00,401
And you have the two boys you want to...

268
00:16:00,402 --> 00:16:03,702
Pass the property on to?

269
00:16:06,372 --> 00:16:08,777
Now, what are you hoping for
at the end of the investigation?

270
00:16:08,778 --> 00:16:10,842
What are you hoping we can get for you?

271
00:16:10,843 --> 00:16:13,546
Just to get straightened out.

272
00:16:13,547 --> 00:16:17,087
Figure out what's going on.

273
00:16:17,092 --> 00:16:20,572
- I need a minute.
- Okay.

274
00:16:25,868 --> 00:16:30,163
There's, like, no
redeeming quality here...

275
00:16:30,164 --> 00:16:32,506
For this place.

276
00:16:32,507 --> 00:16:37,667
It just shouldn't...
shouldn't be anymore, period.

277
00:16:41,851 --> 00:16:44,757
I don't think that the
dead people that are here

278
00:16:44,758 --> 00:16:48,409
want this place to
really even exist anymore.

279
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,157
Why?

280
00:16:50,158 --> 00:16:54,598
I don't know. They get [Bleep] agitated.

281
00:16:54,630 --> 00:17:00,030
And they're yelling, burn
this [Bleep] to the ground!

282
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:20,810
Tysha told me that she thinks her
property used to be a big slave plantation.

283
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:24,290
I'm on my way to meet with a local
genealogist to see if this is really true,

284
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:27,171
or a local legend.

285
00:17:36,112 --> 00:17:39,276
Is it true that the property I'm
investigating was a plantation at one time?

286
00:17:39,277 --> 00:17:41,061
- It was.
- Okay.

287
00:17:41,062 --> 00:17:43,451
They raised tobacco.

288
00:17:43,452 --> 00:17:46,888
And slaves lived a very hard life.

289
00:17:46,889 --> 00:17:50,693
They were fed very little.
They got up early in the day.

290
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:54,129
They worked all day long,
from daylight till dark.

291
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,866
What about medical treatment?

292
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,860
There was probably not
very much medical treatment,

293
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:03,602
for the slave or the landowner because
medicine wasn't like it is today.

294
00:18:03,603 --> 00:18:06,791
Do we know who owned the first plantation
on the property I'm investigating?

295
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:09,994
- The Burks family.
- And how many slaves did they have?

296
00:18:09,995 --> 00:18:13,297
- We show that there were 60.
- And how do we know that?

297
00:18:13,298 --> 00:18:17,601
Well, I have this
document here from 1855.

298
00:18:17,602 --> 00:18:23,502
And it talks about the slaves
that he owned in his inventory.

299
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,624
10 years old, 11 years old.

300
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,478
Were they ever educated?

301
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,681
They were not schooled.

302
00:18:30,682 --> 00:18:35,397
As soon as they were old enough to walk,
they were probably working, as well.

303
00:18:35,398 --> 00:18:39,122
If they died on the property, would
they bury them on the property?

304
00:18:39,123 --> 00:18:40,983
Yes.

305
00:18:44,872 --> 00:18:49,972
There's a lot of black
boys... like, young boys.

306
00:18:50,912 --> 00:18:53,968
Like, I'd say 12 and under.

307
00:18:53,969 --> 00:18:58,083
I do see, like, a school of some sort...

308
00:18:58,084 --> 00:19:00,424
Very small.

309
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,958
But I don't think...

310
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:05,691
The black kids would...

311
00:19:05,692 --> 00:19:09,412
Would be being taught anything.

312
00:19:09,688 --> 00:19:12,001
I think a lot of them
are buried around here.

313
00:19:12,002 --> 00:19:15,753
I do. I think a lot of
them are buried around here.

314
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:19,354
There were 34 graves in all.

315
00:19:20,157 --> 00:19:24,597
And most of them were children's graves.

316
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,360
After meeting Rena, I knew
these archives would hold some

317
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:35,761
pretty appalling stories
about the Burks family slaves.

318
00:19:36,317 --> 00:19:41,730
But as I dig through them, I discover
something completely unexpected.

319
00:19:41,731 --> 00:19:45,191
Some of the slaves had the same last
name as the owner of the plantation...

320
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:47,772
Nicholas Burks.

321
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:54,840
You know, I've got to wonder
if they might be his kids.

322
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,432
I'm headed back to Troy
and Tysha's property,

323
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:04,138
to meet with a local Professor
of African-American studies.

324
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:08,999
Who says she can answer
some of my questions.

325
00:20:14,276 --> 00:20:17,641
That paperwork I sent you about the
plantation, I mean, what do you make

326
00:20:17,642 --> 00:20:22,145
of the five or six young kids with
the same name as the plantation owner?

327
00:20:22,146 --> 00:20:24,930
It was more common than
people like to think.

328
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:29,070
One thing did strike me, though, that one
of the five children with his last name...

329
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:31,651
This person, Monroe...
was listed as Mulatto.

330
00:20:31,652 --> 00:20:35,824
Which is someone who's mixed
race, and that suggests to me

331
00:20:35,825 --> 00:20:39,120
that it's very likely that he
was the plantation owner's son.

332
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:41,455
- Now, was it consensual?
- Not necessarily.

333
00:20:41,456 --> 00:20:42,953
I mean, rape was very common.

334
00:20:42,954 --> 00:20:48,854
If you own a human being, you
can do what you will to them.

335
00:20:50,565 --> 00:20:55,365
Some guy's, like,
slapping this woman a lot.

336
00:20:55,561 --> 00:20:58,913
Beating her up pretty bad.

337
00:20:58,914 --> 00:21:04,814
It seems like he is wealthy,
and it's also like she's nothing.

338
00:21:07,588 --> 00:21:10,688
Is there any way of figuring out who
might have been the mother of this kid?

339
00:21:10,689 --> 00:21:13,656
There is someone on the
papers that you sent,

340
00:21:13,657 --> 00:21:16,494
that looks like she could
be a good fit for his mother.

341
00:21:16,495 --> 00:21:18,219
- It's a woman named Louisa.
- Okay.

342
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,754
And she was 45 years old the same
time that he was 18, listed together.

343
00:21:22,755 --> 00:21:24,881
- So the age range works.
- Okay.

344
00:21:24,882 --> 00:21:29,807
And they were also recorded as running away
during the same period, possibly together.

345
00:21:29,808 --> 00:21:32,127
What would have happened
if they got caught?

346
00:21:32,128 --> 00:21:36,839
Whippings to torture to threatening
to sell your family off...

347
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:42,086
To sell you off down South.
They could have been dismembered.

348
00:21:42,087 --> 00:21:44,923
Now, what kind of a woman would
even take a risk like that?

349
00:21:44,924 --> 00:21:49,096
A brave one. The domestic
slave trade was at its height.

350
00:21:49,097 --> 00:21:50,791
The soil was dying out,

351
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:54,649
and farmers around here and planters
were struggling economically.

352
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,148
So they switched from...

353
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:01,281
Mostly doing crops to
doing human trafficking.

354
00:22:01,282 --> 00:22:07,042
So, she witnessed a huge export
of her family and friends.

355
00:22:07,297 --> 00:22:09,667
That would be one of the reasons
why she took off, I guess.

356
00:22:09,668 --> 00:22:10,636
Absolutely.

357
00:22:10,637 --> 00:22:14,232
That ultimate freedom or the
risk of not being sold down South.

358
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:20,133
Or maybe being separated from her son might
have been enough to make it worth leaving.

359
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:28,314
There are so many emotions...

360
00:22:28,315 --> 00:22:31,745
With this black woman
that it's hard to...

361
00:22:31,746 --> 00:22:33,985
Talk with her.

362
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:37,280
She is just showing me, like, that...

363
00:22:37,281 --> 00:22:41,412
The only good thing in
life were... were children.

364
00:22:41,413 --> 00:22:44,449
That was the only thing
that made her happy.

365
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:50,350
She didn't want anybody else to be
here, so she did things to try...

366
00:22:50,889 --> 00:22:55,292
To set that in motion
when she was alive.

367
00:22:55,293 --> 00:23:00,813
There are secrets here that
some don't want discovered.

368
00:23:00,967 --> 00:23:04,687
They should learn from history.

369
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:13,116
What's going on?

370
00:23:13,545 --> 00:23:16,074
She doesn't want me down here.

371
00:23:16,075 --> 00:23:20,155
I'm in, like, a lot of pain here.

372
00:23:35,126 --> 00:23:39,603
In my research, I found out the property's
tragic history didn't end with slavery.

373
00:23:39,604 --> 00:23:42,333
I turned up a guy by the
name of Starke Robinson,

374
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:45,519
and it seems he lost a
lot of family members.

375
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,090
I'm on my way to meet with a local
librarian who did some digging.

376
00:23:49,091 --> 00:23:54,991
And he says he's got some information
that'll really help my case.

377
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,660
Nathan, what were you able to find
out about this guy, Starke Robinson?

378
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:07,945
Well, actually, we were
able to find out quite a lot.

379
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:12,549
We found out that he is a
native-born Virginian, born in 1826.

380
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,172
He was a plantation owner.

381
00:24:14,173 --> 00:24:18,455
He enlisted with the Confederacy,
and after The Civil War, of course,

382
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:22,017
going back to the plantation,
life wasn't gonna be the same.

383
00:24:22,018 --> 00:24:27,568
So, in 1870, he buys the property
that you're investigating now.

384
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:30,880
Now, I also noticed through
the paperwork, he had some loss.

385
00:24:30,881 --> 00:24:36,640
Yes, he in fact, had three wives throughout
his life, and he outlived all of them.

386
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:41,500
His first wife died before The Civil
War in 1857 when she was just 30.

387
00:24:41,501 --> 00:24:46,191
His second wife, Ellen, in 1871... just
a year after he buys the property...

388
00:24:46,192 --> 00:24:49,271
She died of complications that
occurred during childbirth.

389
00:24:49,272 --> 00:24:50,082
Okay.

390
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:54,814
And the child that she gave birth
to also passed away at that time.

391
00:24:54,815 --> 00:24:59,435
We have some of the
cemetery records here.

392
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,780
After Ellen dies, not long after, Starke
marries her younger sister, Elizabeth.

393
00:25:06,825 --> 00:25:09,933
- Okay.
- And then she lived until 1904.

394
00:25:09,934 --> 00:25:13,834
They were together over 30 years.

395
00:25:20,283 --> 00:25:26,183
I'm getting these two little
white ladies, and they're sisters.

396
00:25:26,642 --> 00:25:29,369
Do you know what kind of
connection these women might have,

397
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:31,090
to this location?

398
00:25:31,091 --> 00:25:35,591
I feel like they owned it at some point.

399
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,235
One of them is young.

400
00:25:41,236 --> 00:25:45,876
She's from, maybe, like
nineteen oh five or nineteen ten.

401
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,775
She has dead children.

402
00:25:48,776 --> 00:25:53,087
And then somebody said, well, you know,
in the end, there's just blood, anyway.

403
00:25:53,088 --> 00:25:55,316
Sickness and death. That's it.

404
00:25:55,317 --> 00:25:58,361
I don't like it at all.

405
00:25:58,362 --> 00:26:02,556
If we look at the cemetery
records that we have, we can see...

406
00:26:02,557 --> 00:26:05,988
That Starke actually
ended up outliving...

407
00:26:05,989 --> 00:26:09,109
7 of his 14 children.

408
00:26:09,257 --> 00:26:11,233
Four died in childbirth.

409
00:26:11,234 --> 00:26:14,566
So, this guy Starke
kind of had a rough go.

410
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:15,833
Yeah.

411
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:18,708
He actually dies in 1915.

412
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:22,669
I have the death certificate here.

413
00:26:24,218 --> 00:26:30,118
He's 89 years old, which in
1915, was quite an advanced age.

414
00:26:31,163 --> 00:26:33,167
Now, would they have been
buried on the property?

415
00:26:33,168 --> 00:26:36,574
Yes, and in fact, there is
a cemetery on the property,

416
00:26:36,575 --> 00:26:41,495
not far from the house
that Robinson lived in.

417
00:26:44,846 --> 00:26:48,986
There's so much residual information.

418
00:26:52,755 --> 00:26:56,833
I know there's other deaths here
because they're saying, like...

419
00:26:56,834 --> 00:26:59,185
Like, at one point, they show
me, like, literally, like,

420
00:26:59,186 --> 00:27:03,026
the floors are covered in blood.

421
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:10,132
For whatever reason, all
the people that lived here...

422
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:13,793
Met with darkness and tragedy.

423
00:27:20,536 --> 00:27:23,678
There were several entities
that stood out during my walk.

424
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,681
But what has me the most concerned,

425
00:27:25,682 --> 00:27:29,857
is the bizarre scene I
encountered in the basement.

426
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:34,358
There were several
dead black men laying.

427
00:27:34,761 --> 00:27:36,338
Mm-hmm.

428
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:39,585
There's two black women.

429
00:27:39,586 --> 00:27:43,726
They're pouring water on the bodies.

430
00:27:46,975 --> 00:27:51,115
- Amy, is this what you saw?
- Yes.

431
00:28:15,405 --> 00:28:18,669
After days of investigating
our clients' property,

432
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:21,697
Amy and I are ready to
reveal what we found.

433
00:28:21,698 --> 00:28:23,832
Amy, I'd like you to
meet Troy and Tysha.

434
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:27,804
This is their house and property.
It's very close to their hearts.

435
00:28:27,805 --> 00:28:30,985
Troy's family's had this
property since the early 1930s.

436
00:28:30,986 --> 00:28:34,881
The only problem is Tysha
and her two young boys,

437
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:36,752
have been having health problems.

438
00:28:36,753 --> 00:28:39,060
And they want to know if
there's any way they can stay.

439
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:41,696
This house is very
important to both of them.

440
00:28:41,697 --> 00:28:43,932
So, with that, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy,

441
00:28:43,933 --> 00:28:49,213
and have her talk about
her walk for a little bit.

442
00:28:50,406 --> 00:28:55,544
When I first got here, there were
like 15 dead people walking by the car.

443
00:28:55,545 --> 00:29:00,890
It was extremely stressful just
how many there are on this property.

444
00:29:00,891 --> 00:29:04,514
And the main feelings
that kind of permeates

445
00:29:04,515 --> 00:29:09,675
this entire area was
sadness and despair and pain.

446
00:29:09,686 --> 00:29:15,220
And I did get that there were
a lot of people buried here.

447
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:19,181
Well, we have bouts of depression.

448
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:21,586
Okay.

449
00:29:21,646 --> 00:29:26,372
Well, there have been a lot of people
that have lived and died on this property.

450
00:29:26,373 --> 00:29:30,098
But this may influence what you
saw, so I'm gonna hold off for now.

451
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:32,019
Okay.

452
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:36,222
When I was upstairs,
I did meet two sisters.

453
00:29:36,223 --> 00:29:38,720
They were from the early 1900s.

454
00:29:38,721 --> 00:29:41,657
They owned this property
at some point in time.

455
00:29:41,658 --> 00:29:44,859
And I felt sickness and death with them.

456
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,857
One of the sisters
had children who died.

457
00:29:47,858 --> 00:29:53,268
And I think that if people see them,
they're just kind of like a mist.

458
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:55,797
Why don't you explain the mist to her?

459
00:29:55,798 --> 00:29:59,101
The mist I've seen has been
kind of a black-color mist.

460
00:29:59,102 --> 00:30:01,153
Where did you see that?

461
00:30:01,154 --> 00:30:04,070
Right above this doorway.

462
00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:06,076
In the basement a lot, too.

463
00:30:06,077 --> 00:30:07,616
Okay.

464
00:30:07,617 --> 00:30:10,759
I could tell you about
at least four people...

465
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,466
That I know that are
buried on the land here.

466
00:30:13,467 --> 00:30:16,301
When you mentioned sisters... there
was a guy named Starke Robinson

467
00:30:16,302 --> 00:30:18,901
who bought the property
here and the house in 1870.

468
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:21,116
He moved here with his wife, Ellen,

469
00:30:21,117 --> 00:30:24,677
who, within a year, actually
passed away at a young age.

470
00:30:24,678 --> 00:30:28,552
About five years later,
he married her sister...

471
00:30:28,553 --> 00:30:32,513
Elizabeth, who died in this house.

472
00:30:32,845 --> 00:30:35,703
- Now, you mentioned dead kids.
- Mm-hmm.

473
00:30:35,704 --> 00:30:40,410
This guy had 14 children, seven
of them which died before he did.

474
00:30:40,411 --> 00:30:43,439
- Four of them died at childbirth.
- Geez.

475
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,138
So, Starke, his two wives, and one of
the children are buried on the property.

476
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,774
Wow.

477
00:30:50,775 --> 00:30:53,371
- That make sense?
- Oh, yeah.

478
00:30:53,372 --> 00:30:56,107
The one thing that became
apparent was that...

479
00:30:56,108 --> 00:31:00,651
Some of the dead from this
house go over to the new house.

480
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:03,216
Specifically, I saw two boys.

481
00:31:03,217 --> 00:31:07,342
And they're always running around,
laughing, and just messing around.

482
00:31:07,343 --> 00:31:12,431
I got them being very active in the
hallway over there and in your bedroom.

483
00:31:12,432 --> 00:31:14,134
Wow.

484
00:31:14,135 --> 00:31:15,711
That's part of the reason we're here,

485
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,771
Troy and Tysha have been
living here for 10 years.

486
00:31:17,772 --> 00:31:19,472
They lived seven years in this house.

487
00:31:19,473 --> 00:31:22,557
- Okay.
- But things got so bad...

488
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:26,161
They decided to build over there, but...

489
00:31:26,162 --> 00:31:29,570
Same things just continued to happen.

490
00:31:29,571 --> 00:31:30,675
Your son is seeing...

491
00:31:30,676 --> 00:31:34,303
- Apparitions of a little boy.
- Yeah. Yeah.

492
00:31:34,304 --> 00:31:36,164
Wow.

493
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:39,059
Not good.

494
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:44,388
What else did you see?

495
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:49,266
So, when I went into the basement,
which is not a good place...

496
00:31:49,267 --> 00:31:50,752
No.

497
00:31:50,753 --> 00:31:55,253
I saw 4 to 10 black men that were dead.

498
00:31:56,186 --> 00:31:58,845
They were all lined up, and
they were extremely thin...

499
00:31:58,846 --> 00:32:02,665
Almost like the pictures from,
like, the holocaust victims.

500
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:07,703
And there were two women that were
throwing water on their bodies.

501
00:32:07,704 --> 00:32:12,948
There are people down there
that really hate white people.

502
00:32:12,949 --> 00:32:14,472
Well, it makes sense.

503
00:32:14,473 --> 00:32:18,379
Back in its heyday, this
was a tobacco plantation.

504
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,748
Hmm.

505
00:32:19,749 --> 00:32:22,433
And from the 1830s up
until around The Civil War,

506
00:32:22,434 --> 00:32:24,386
it was owned by the Burks family.

507
00:32:24,387 --> 00:32:27,503
They had up to 60 slaves.

508
00:32:27,504 --> 00:32:33,404
And the basement of this house
was some of their living quarters.

509
00:32:34,597 --> 00:32:39,499
- To tell you how they were treated and...
- I know how they were treated.

510
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,760
I sketched that scene in the basement.

511
00:32:48,852 --> 00:32:50,772
Geez.

512
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:53,985
Take a look at that.

513
00:32:55,638 --> 00:32:57,498
Wow.

514
00:33:01,524 --> 00:33:05,647
I've always known that there
were slaves on the premises...

515
00:33:05,648 --> 00:33:08,828
But it's sad to see that in the picture.

516
00:33:08,829 --> 00:33:10,188
It's sickening to me.

517
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:11,893
Do you know why they
were throwing water,

518
00:33:11,894 --> 00:33:14,097
because there were flies on
them or something like that?

519
00:33:14,098 --> 00:33:17,734
- Maybe. I don't know.
- Okay.

520
00:33:17,735 --> 00:33:21,009
These guys feel really
uncomfortable down in that basement.

521
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:23,812
Is this the reason why
they're feeling uncomfortable?

522
00:33:23,813 --> 00:33:29,713
Well, the thing is, is that the
larger lady is still down there.

523
00:33:32,202 --> 00:33:34,071
She's very, very present.

524
00:33:34,072 --> 00:33:39,551
And she doesn't want anybody in
there, especially if they're white.

525
00:33:39,552 --> 00:33:44,265
I'd never felt hatred like
that from an entity in my life.

526
00:33:44,266 --> 00:33:48,708
One thing that she kept saying is that
she wants the living to learn from history.

527
00:33:48,709 --> 00:33:51,681
And then she showed me children,

528
00:33:51,682 --> 00:33:55,107
and said that they were the
only good thing in her life.

529
00:33:55,108 --> 00:33:57,665
And she didn't want people here.

530
00:33:57,666 --> 00:34:00,142
She didn't want to be
here, because she knew when

531
00:34:00,143 --> 00:34:04,299
she got here that this
was not a good place.

532
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,580
A couple things you said,

533
00:34:05,581 --> 00:34:09,258
made me think of a slave that used
to live here by the name of Louisa.

534
00:34:09,259 --> 00:34:11,259
She was about 45 years old.

535
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:15,897
And there was another slave by the
name of Monroe who was about 18.

536
00:34:15,898 --> 00:34:18,774
Now, this slave was
half white, half black.

537
00:34:18,775 --> 00:34:23,505
And the paperwork has them
listed as being two runaways.

538
00:34:23,506 --> 00:34:27,031
They ran away at the
same time, basically.

539
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:29,597
Now, from what the
historian I spoke to said,

540
00:34:29,598 --> 00:34:32,413
she was probably raped by
one of the plantation owners.

541
00:34:32,414 --> 00:34:35,705
She had this child that was
half black, half white...

542
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,753
And they took a big
chance and they ran away.

543
00:34:38,754 --> 00:34:43,228
Now, if you ran away back in those
days on a plantation, you got caught...

544
00:34:43,229 --> 00:34:46,751
You were either sent to another plantation,
which was a lot worse than here...

545
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:49,430
They'd dismember you, or they kill you.

546
00:34:49,431 --> 00:34:51,581
That's really sad.

547
00:34:51,582 --> 00:34:55,357
Her presence is extremely dangerous...

548
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:58,422
And incredibly powerful.

549
00:34:58,423 --> 00:35:01,753
She's also trying to
give you guys warnings.

550
00:35:01,754 --> 00:35:03,463
What kind of warnings
are we talking about?

551
00:35:03,464 --> 00:35:05,864
To get out.

552
00:35:09,251 --> 00:35:11,125
I was in extreme pain.

553
00:35:11,126 --> 00:35:15,419
I did feel that there was probably some
physical abuse towards the adults here.

554
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,602
You saw physical abuse
towards the living adults here?

555
00:35:17,603 --> 00:35:19,463
Yes.

556
00:35:20,365 --> 00:35:24,335
It's not that she is doing it directly.

557
00:35:24,336 --> 00:35:27,403
She controls the dead here.

558
00:35:27,404 --> 00:35:31,740
We was redoing the room up there,
and there was a lot of sheetrock...

559
00:35:31,741 --> 00:35:33,842
Like, couple thousand pounds.

560
00:35:33,843 --> 00:35:39,743
And it was all pushed against the wall,
and the whole thing came over on me.

561
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:43,811
My aches and pains have
gotten worse, big-time.

562
00:35:43,812 --> 00:35:48,957
I shouldn't be feeling this beat
down, like I'm 60-some years old.

563
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:50,504
How about the kids?

564
00:35:50,505 --> 00:35:53,267
Do you think their health issues
might have been related to the house?

565
00:35:53,268 --> 00:35:55,041
Oh, yeah.

566
00:35:55,042 --> 00:35:57,982
Yeah. Getting worse.

567
00:35:58,131 --> 00:36:03,260
One of them, he has autism, and
the other one has Asperger's.

568
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,151
And you've been in a lot of pain.

569
00:36:05,152 --> 00:36:08,341
Oh, yes. It's, like, all over.

570
00:36:08,342 --> 00:36:10,311
- Mm-hmm.
- It gets worse.

571
00:36:10,312 --> 00:36:13,943
There's moments that it seems like I'm
away from the property, it's not as bad.

572
00:36:13,944 --> 00:36:18,084
Well, she's extremely powerful, yeah.

573
00:36:21,409 --> 00:36:25,129
She is the hoodoo practitioner.

574
00:36:25,401 --> 00:36:27,128
What is hoodoo?

575
00:36:27,129 --> 00:36:29,297
Hoodoo comes from Africa.

576
00:36:29,298 --> 00:36:32,438
And it was certain tribes that had
gone through the Christianization.

577
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:34,520
When you first said that,
I thought you meant Voodoo.

578
00:36:34,521 --> 00:36:36,537
No, Voodoo is a religion.

579
00:36:36,538 --> 00:36:42,118
Hoodoo is not a religion,
but a system to place spells.

580
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:47,857
And she put them into
place while she was alive,

581
00:36:47,858 --> 00:36:52,203
to ensure things would go the
way she wanted them to in death.

582
00:36:52,204 --> 00:36:55,284
Because hoodoo is all
about gaining power.

583
00:36:55,285 --> 00:36:57,228
And now she's got all this power...

584
00:36:57,229 --> 00:37:02,357
She's got all these dead
people that she controls.

585
00:37:02,358 --> 00:37:05,517
And she had put a binding spell out.

586
00:37:05,518 --> 00:37:07,214
What do you mean by that?

587
00:37:07,215 --> 00:37:10,371
Well, I couldn't have full
communication with the dead.

588
00:37:10,372 --> 00:37:12,557
Like, I couldn't talk
about being whipped.

589
00:37:12,558 --> 00:37:15,979
I could not talk about what I
was experiencing at the time.

590
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:21,249
Which is weird, because her message is
the main message that needs to be heard.

591
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:24,636
Well, if she has a message
she wants out, what is it?

592
00:37:24,637 --> 00:37:28,297
What does she want from them?

593
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:32,690
She wants the house demolished.

594
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:53,671
Her message is the main
message that needs to be heard.

595
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:57,028
Well, if she has a message
she wants out, what is it?

596
00:37:57,029 --> 00:38:00,135
What does she want from them?

597
00:38:00,136 --> 00:38:03,856
She wants the house demolished.

598
00:38:09,278 --> 00:38:12,025
That ain't gonna happen.

599
00:38:12,026 --> 00:38:16,286
I'll just keep on with her, I guess.

600
00:38:16,448 --> 00:38:18,854
I'm not gonna tear nothing down.

601
00:38:18,855 --> 00:38:22,523
She's not the only
one who feels this way.

602
00:38:22,524 --> 00:38:25,794
All of the dead want it gone.

603
00:38:25,795 --> 00:38:29,590
So, how many ghosts do we have?

604
00:38:29,591 --> 00:38:32,651
I would say hundreds.

605
00:38:34,765 --> 00:38:36,704
I'm... I'm very concerned.

606
00:38:36,705 --> 00:38:39,875
She wants this house gone.

607
00:38:39,876 --> 00:38:43,827
She's bound everybody else around
her... all the other dead people.

608
00:38:43,828 --> 00:38:46,148
I'm keeping the house up.

609
00:38:46,149 --> 00:38:49,495
I'm not tearing my house down.

610
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:52,428
I don't give up on anything.

611
00:38:52,429 --> 00:38:55,094
Plus you had plans on one day
passing this on to your kids.

612
00:38:55,095 --> 00:38:56,451
Sure.

613
00:38:56,452 --> 00:38:59,952
I'll be damned if I let any
kind of stuff like that stand,

614
00:38:59,953 --> 00:39:02,864
into anything that I got to
do with my kids, you know?

615
00:39:02,865 --> 00:39:05,354
You know, you're like me
in a way. You look pissed.

616
00:39:05,355 --> 00:39:08,837
Yeah. I'm a really hard-headed guy.

617
00:39:08,838 --> 00:39:13,000
And we'll butt heads
for right now, I guess.

618
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:16,812
If he wants to butt heads with
this woman, what could happen?

619
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:18,392
You're in for it.

620
00:39:18,393 --> 00:39:21,438
Yeah. I'm not backing down
from where I'm at right now.

621
00:39:21,439 --> 00:39:24,100
I've worked too hard to
be where I'm at right now.

622
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:27,646
I'd be letting a lot
of my ancestors down.

623
00:39:27,647 --> 00:39:30,170
I don't know. I mean, I'm
really confused by the whole...

624
00:39:30,171 --> 00:39:32,484
You know, we've tried
to protect this place,

625
00:39:32,485 --> 00:39:35,692
and everybody's tried to
be respectful to the place.

626
00:39:35,693 --> 00:39:38,195
You're white.

627
00:39:38,196 --> 00:39:42,198
She won't listen to what you're saying.

628
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:44,448
Period. End of story.

629
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:48,709
Told you there was a lot more to it.

630
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:55,345
This has been probably one of the
most intense investigations we've done.

631
00:39:55,346 --> 00:39:58,118
And obviously, this has
been a lot for you guys,

632
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:00,279
but the most pressing question here...

633
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:05,164
Is it safe for you to stay on your property
and pass this house along to your kids?

634
00:40:05,165 --> 00:40:11,065
For that, I'm gonna turn it over to
Amy, see if she has an answer for you.

635
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:15,870
Obviously, the easiest way to go
would be to demolish the house...

636
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,954
Which it sounds like
you're not going to do.

637
00:40:18,955 --> 00:40:22,945
So, my other suggestion would be to...

638
00:40:22,946 --> 00:40:25,445
Find a hoodoo practitioner.

639
00:40:25,446 --> 00:40:27,505
Because this is about gaining power.

640
00:40:27,506 --> 00:40:32,384
You get another hoodoo person in
who would want to attain her power.

641
00:40:32,385 --> 00:40:35,436
And they're gonna take her with them.

642
00:40:35,437 --> 00:40:38,985
Because they're gonna then
have access to her power.

643
00:40:38,986 --> 00:40:43,782
So, your advice to them is to get
somebody that practices hoodoo that...

644
00:40:43,783 --> 00:40:46,396
Won't be afraid of
this, but want the power?

645
00:40:46,397 --> 00:40:48,328
Right. Would want to take her.

646
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:51,292
I mean, I don't think you look up the
yellow pages for something like this.

647
00:40:51,293 --> 00:40:55,603
I mean, it is hard to find
someone who practices true hoodoo.

648
00:40:55,604 --> 00:41:01,112
But maybe going to the universities,
they might know practitioners.

649
00:41:01,113 --> 00:41:04,148
Okay. That's where we'll start, then.

650
00:41:04,149 --> 00:41:07,153
If we get this other one to
come in here and kick her ass...

651
00:41:07,154 --> 00:41:10,207
Is all these other spirits
that's underneath her,

652
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:12,381
will they be let go and everything?

653
00:41:12,382 --> 00:41:14,242
Yes.

654
00:41:14,368 --> 00:41:16,529
Let me ask you a
question about this house.

655
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:19,229
Should they stay away
from this house until...

656
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:22,056
I'm not. I'm over here all the time.

657
00:41:22,057 --> 00:41:25,487
- You're not even gonna try to stay away?
- No. Mm-mm.

658
00:41:25,488 --> 00:41:28,512
If I were you, I would probably
be very, very, very careful

659
00:41:28,513 --> 00:41:31,032
if I came into this house.

660
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:35,233
So, we'll take it a day at a time.

661
00:41:35,823 --> 00:41:39,898
So, are you guys gonna follow Amy's
advice and find a hoodoo practitioner?

662
00:41:39,899 --> 00:41:41,624
Yeah, most definitely. Most definitely.

663
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:45,006
Oh, yeah. Tomorrow.
Not gonna let her win.

664
00:41:45,007 --> 00:41:48,267
She's done too much damage already.

665
00:41:48,268 --> 00:41:51,468
I can't force Troy to do
something he doesn't want to do,

666
00:41:51,469 --> 00:41:55,112
and I don't know if he fully
understands what he's about to take on...

667
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:57,986
But I'm afraid he's about to.
