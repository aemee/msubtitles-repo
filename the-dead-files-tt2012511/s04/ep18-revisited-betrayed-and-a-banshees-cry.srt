1
00:00:05,479 --> 00:00:06,646
My God.

2
00:00:06,647 --> 00:00:09,482
Tonight on Dead Files Revisited...

3
00:00:09,483 --> 00:00:12,084
He wants to slit my throat.

4
00:00:12,085 --> 00:00:17,023
A second look at some of Amy and
Steve's most terrifying cases.

5
00:00:17,024 --> 00:00:18,892
That's no way to live.

6
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,026
New information...

7
00:00:20,027 --> 00:00:22,128
I actually started
thinking that I was nuts.

8
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:23,830
Startling revelations.

9
00:00:23,831 --> 00:00:26,265
Why are you picking on
my kids? Come after me.

10
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:28,234
First...

11
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:30,403
A return to Egg Harbor, New Jersey...

12
00:00:30,404 --> 00:00:33,139
The kids are completely freaked out.

13
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,841
Where a savage monster...

14
00:00:34,842 --> 00:00:36,287
It scared the living crap out of me.

15
00:00:36,288 --> 00:00:37,428
Unleashes hell.

16
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:40,224
His goal is vengeance.

17
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:43,015
Then we travel back
to Carmel, New York...

18
00:00:43,016 --> 00:00:46,285
I turned around, and...
whoom!... I got tossed.

19
00:00:46,286 --> 00:00:47,821
Where a local restaurant...

20
00:00:47,822 --> 00:00:49,456
I see pools of blood.

21
00:00:49,457 --> 00:00:51,491
Possesses a deadly threat.

22
00:00:51,492 --> 00:00:53,726
That person's gonna die.

23
00:00:53,727 --> 00:00:55,126
Did they listen to Amy?

24
00:00:55,127 --> 00:00:56,893
Are you gonna take her advice?

25
00:00:56,894 --> 00:00:59,165
Or are they cursed for life?

26
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:03,186
Spirits be gone. Leave this family.

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,721
They're being watched.

28
00:01:06,722 --> 00:01:09,721
My name is Amy Allan.

29
00:01:09,722 --> 00:01:12,217
This thing likes death.

30
00:01:12,218 --> 00:01:13,645
I see dead people.

31
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:15,280
This thing's, like, a monster.

32
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:17,315
I speak to dead people.

33
00:01:17,316 --> 00:01:19,195
And he's pissed off now.

34
00:01:19,196 --> 00:01:20,466
And they speak to me.

35
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:22,044
His head was cracked.

36
00:01:22,045 --> 00:01:25,631
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

37
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:27,181
This guy was murdered.

38
00:01:27,182 --> 00:01:28,698
I rely on my partner.

39
00:01:28,699 --> 00:01:31,852
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

40
00:01:31,853 --> 00:01:34,566
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

41
00:01:34,567 --> 00:01:37,820
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

42
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:39,337
You saw her?

43
00:01:39,338 --> 00:01:40,572
It's my job to reveal them.

44
00:01:40,573 --> 00:01:41,853
Why would you stay here?

45
00:01:41,854 --> 00:01:43,891
But Steve and I never speak...

46
00:01:43,892 --> 00:01:46,010
We never communicate
during an investigation.

47
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:47,379
Until the very end.

48
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,214
Stop it.

49
00:01:49,215 --> 00:01:51,083
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

50
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:53,685
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

51
00:01:53,686 --> 00:01:54,986
Or time to get out.

52
00:01:54,987 --> 00:01:59,727
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

53
00:02:11,426 --> 00:02:14,611
When the call came in from a young
couple in Egg Harbor, New Jersey,

54
00:02:14,612 --> 00:02:16,577
they were at the end of their rope.

55
00:02:16,578 --> 00:02:18,086
They said ghosts were taking over,

56
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:22,287
and they were convinced something in
the house was making their daughter sick.

57
00:02:22,288 --> 00:02:24,207
And even I didn't know
at that time that things

58
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:29,128
were a whole lot worse
than they had imagined.

59
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:32,780
All right, Jess, so, tell
me about what's going on.

60
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:36,642
The kids are starting to
see things... shadow figures.

61
00:02:36,643 --> 00:02:39,122
My husband is completely freaked out.

62
00:02:39,123 --> 00:02:41,333
And it's just escalating.

63
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:44,773
It's one thing for me that my
husband would be experiencing things.

64
00:02:44,774 --> 00:02:50,491
But once the kids started to, like,
see things, it became more alarming.

65
00:02:50,492 --> 00:02:52,800
Now, the kids... what's
going on with them?

66
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:56,209
My son... he will not go
into his room for any reason.

67
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,705
He doesn't sleep in there, nothing.

68
00:02:57,706 --> 00:03:00,970
He just says he just doesn't like it, like
there's just someone in there with him.

69
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:02,702
What about the other kids?

70
00:03:02,703 --> 00:03:08,603
My daughter... she's been sick for
over two years, and nobody knows why.

71
00:03:09,217 --> 00:03:14,737
It's heartbreaking, and
that's why we called you guys.

72
00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:33,335
I felt, like, this huge...

73
00:03:33,357 --> 00:03:36,057
Being behind me.

74
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,913
And I thought it was
a big shadow person.

75
00:03:40,914 --> 00:03:44,043
I've been battling shadow
people my entire life,

76
00:03:44,044 --> 00:03:47,245
so I'm always on edge
when I think I see one.

77
00:03:47,246 --> 00:03:51,683
But when I looked, I knew
that it was just a guy.

78
00:03:51,684 --> 00:03:57,584
But I could only breathe easy for a second
before that man gave me a vicious warning.

79
00:03:57,884 --> 00:04:00,524
He, wants to...

80
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:03,327
Slit my throat.

81
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:10,951
I had a dream that there was
a kid standing in my closet.

82
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:14,125
I followed him out of the
bedroom, into the kitchen.

83
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:20,026
He stopped at the basement door, went
like this for me to follow him, so I did.

84
00:04:22,515 --> 00:04:26,122
I woke up from my dream. I
was standing on the landing.

85
00:04:26,123 --> 00:04:30,650
Like, I physically got out of bed
and followed this kid in my sleep.

86
00:04:30,651 --> 00:04:33,294
With all of the activity in
the house, I was losing my mind

87
00:04:33,295 --> 00:04:37,400
because for the first five years, no
one else had experienced it besides me.

88
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:40,851
And then when my husband
finally started to see things,

89
00:04:40,852 --> 00:04:43,783
it validated my
experiences because I knew,

90
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,499
there was something legitimately
going on in the house.

91
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,614
It's got to be tough for
you to sleep in here, then.

92
00:04:48,615 --> 00:04:53,984
Yes. And there was a time where, for
a straight year, I slept on the couch.

93
00:04:53,985 --> 00:04:57,825
- That's no way to live.
- No.

94
00:05:01,859 --> 00:05:05,159
What are you looking at?

95
00:05:06,397 --> 00:05:09,884
They kind of look like
little, tiny jellyfishes.

96
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:13,540
With, like, the long tentacles.

97
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,427
They're on the ceiling.
They're always moving.

98
00:05:15,428 --> 00:05:18,548
They're always around.

99
00:05:19,177 --> 00:05:22,247
They're trying to organize
themselves to become a being.

100
00:05:22,248 --> 00:05:26,449
To this day, even I can't believe
I saw those strange creatures.

101
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:31,721
But despite my doubts, I couldn't
deny their heinous intentions.

102
00:05:31,722 --> 00:05:35,270
What sort of things
can they do to people?

103
00:05:35,271 --> 00:05:38,271
They are aggravating.

104
00:05:38,429 --> 00:05:42,496
They would cause stress,
a sense of unease.

105
00:05:44,297 --> 00:05:45,902
Insomnia.

106
00:05:45,903 --> 00:05:47,719
Are they dangerous?

107
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,300
Yes, they are.

108
00:05:51,357 --> 00:05:53,269
The instant I met Jessee's husband,

109
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,228
I thought I had him pegged as a
tough guy, but he threw me for a loop.

110
00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:00,017
For a husband to admit he's
more scared than his wife,

111
00:06:00,018 --> 00:06:04,878
something screwed-up
had to be in that house.

112
00:06:10,145 --> 00:06:13,007
We were coming back from a
barbecue, walking up to the house.

113
00:06:13,008 --> 00:06:14,935
We came up on the front porch,

114
00:06:14,936 --> 00:06:17,807
and I seen a shadowy figure
appear through the curtain.

115
00:06:17,808 --> 00:06:19,670
- Okay.
- It scared the living crap out of me.

116
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,665
Now, you don't look like you scare easy.

117
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,864
It scared me enough where
I had to call my 4'9 wife

118
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:25,990
to come up to the front
porch and go inside the house.

119
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:27,015
Really?

120
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:30,818
Nobody wants to believe that
you have ghosts or spirits or,

121
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:32,008
anything in your house.

122
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:35,715
So I really didn't want to
believe what Jessee had to say.

123
00:06:35,716 --> 00:06:38,231
But when I had finally
seen something for myself,

124
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:41,540
it really freaked me out because I
really thought somebody was in my house.

125
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,824
Was this the first time
you saw something like that?

126
00:06:43,825 --> 00:06:45,954
Actually, two nights ago, I had a dream.

127
00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:50,696
And in that dream, in the corner of the
bedroom, there was a black shadowy figure.

128
00:06:50,697 --> 00:06:54,353
And it just kind of went for me,
and I woke up at the same time.

129
00:06:54,354 --> 00:06:58,434
I had the chills from head to toe.

130
00:07:02,528 --> 00:07:06,128
There's a sickness here.

131
00:07:11,237 --> 00:07:16,686
It just keeps feeling like I'm getting
punched in the stomach by this male...

132
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:21,427
Who initially I thought
was a shadow person.

133
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,184
It's like, get the **** out.

134
00:07:26,185 --> 00:07:27,874
Like, get out of here. Get out of here.

135
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,653
Get out of here. Get out of here.

136
00:07:30,654 --> 00:07:33,035
The dead man who
threatened to cut my throat

137
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:36,455
did everything in his power
to get me out of that house.

138
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:41,613
Looking back, I think he didn't
want me figuring out his cruel plan.

139
00:07:41,614 --> 00:07:44,436
He feels like he was
ripped off and betrayed.

140
00:07:44,437 --> 00:07:48,140
And the crawly things in the room...

141
00:07:48,141 --> 00:07:52,452
I know he wants them to be
here, and he wants them to...

142
00:07:52,453 --> 00:07:55,210
Come together and form a being.

143
00:07:55,211 --> 00:07:57,622
Are you talking about
the jellyfish creatures?

144
00:07:57,623 --> 00:07:59,483
Yes.

145
00:07:59,764 --> 00:08:03,341
And they're not good, these things.

146
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:06,582
They're not. He's not.

147
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,486
Next...

148
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:10,161
Sounds like he got screwed over.

149
00:08:10,162 --> 00:08:12,397
Deception leads to revenge.

150
00:08:12,398 --> 00:08:15,367
They're cursed, really. They're cursed.

151
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:17,510
And in our second investigation...

152
00:08:17,511 --> 00:08:19,302
I took off like a bat out of hell.

153
00:08:19,303 --> 00:08:22,319
A vengeful spirit releases her wrath.

154
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,040
She really hates living people.

155
00:08:39,368 --> 00:08:41,225
It didn't take long to track down

156
00:08:41,226 --> 00:08:43,625
the previous owner of
Jessee and Fred's house.

157
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:46,036
The time that woman had
spent there was heartbreaking.

158
00:08:46,037 --> 00:08:51,937
And by the end of our interview,
I couldn't help but feel her pain.

159
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,519
So, Linda, I understand you grew
up in the house I'm investigating.

160
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,587
Yes.

161
00:08:59,588 --> 00:09:03,554
It was my mother, my father,
my brother, Louis, and myself.

162
00:09:03,555 --> 00:09:04,610
Okay.

163
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:07,361
Now, you had mentioned on the
phone there was some tragedy

164
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:08,968
at home when you were living there.

165
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:13,289
- What happened?
- My brother had died.

166
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:19,788
He had committed suicide.
He had hung himself...

167
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:22,350
- In the basement.
- Geez.

168
00:09:22,351 --> 00:09:25,651
- How old was he?
- 14.

169
00:09:25,803 --> 00:09:28,263
It was 1970.

170
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:32,231
- Who found him?
- My mother. She found him there.

171
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:36,881
And she yelled and asked
me to bring a knife down...

172
00:09:36,882 --> 00:09:38,661
Because she had to cut him down.

173
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:40,766
Geez.

174
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:42,826
How did your father deal with that?

175
00:09:42,827 --> 00:09:46,907
After that, everything went downhill.

176
00:09:48,106 --> 00:09:53,146
He said he was hearing voices
and there was people in his house.

177
00:09:53,147 --> 00:09:56,927
He was diagnosed with psychosis.

178
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:00,882
When your father died, how old was he?

179
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:02,217
87.

180
00:10:02,218 --> 00:10:04,617
He was like an empty shell.

181
00:10:04,618 --> 00:10:09,538
The man I knew... he
just... he wasn't there.

182
00:10:13,496 --> 00:10:17,665
There is, like, this old man
that's bopping around, too.

183
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,246
He's like 80.

184
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:24,565
And he wanders mostly...

185
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:29,889
He's confused.

186
00:10:30,644 --> 00:10:34,515
When I see a dead person, it can
be at any given point in their life.

187
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:36,951
Typically, they have control over this.

188
00:10:36,952 --> 00:10:41,622
But this old man had somehow become
a prisoner of his mentally ill state.

189
00:10:41,623 --> 00:10:45,236
He does have moments of clarity where...

190
00:10:45,237 --> 00:10:49,257
He knows that there's people here.

191
00:10:49,863 --> 00:10:53,353
But then he gets even more confused.

192
00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:59,054
There is activity in the
closet because he goes in there.

193
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:07,748
They look all cute and
harmless, and then they're crazy.

194
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:10,351
My talk with Linda moved me.

195
00:11:10,352 --> 00:11:15,156
That house was clearly marked with tragedy,
and the more I dug, the worse it got.

196
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:17,149
After speaking to a local genealogist,

197
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:23,050
it seemed like every family associated
with that property ended up suffering.

198
00:11:30,582 --> 00:11:32,707
So, Bob, what were you able to find out?

199
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:36,634
I was able to take the
title back to the mid-1850s.

200
00:11:36,635 --> 00:11:40,130
When a group of wealthy
German financiers...

201
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:43,214
Acquired 38,000 acres of land.

202
00:11:43,215 --> 00:11:44,996
And wanted to develop a town.

203
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,990
So, who wound up settling on the land?

204
00:11:46,991 --> 00:11:49,757
There were two brothers...
an Ignatz and Louis Roesch.

205
00:11:49,758 --> 00:11:54,695
They were German immigrants who came over
here expecting the land of opportunity.

206
00:11:54,696 --> 00:11:56,978
Okay, so, what did they
find when they got here?

207
00:11:56,979 --> 00:12:00,835
A little stark reality. I think
it was woods and mesquites.

208
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:04,205
They were met with very
difficult conditions.

209
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:09,782
Louis had a total of six
children, three of which died.

210
00:12:09,783 --> 00:12:13,874
If they would have had the hospitals
and the proper medical attention,

211
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,806
they could have done
something different.

212
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:18,181
- Sounds like he got screwed over.
- Yes.

213
00:12:18,182 --> 00:12:22,874
I can't imagine this is the life he
dreamt of when he left his home country.

214
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,795
Okay.

215
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:32,689
This man who I thought
was a shadow person...

216
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:37,516
There was something with money
and him and even his family.

217
00:12:37,517 --> 00:12:38,809
I don't know.

218
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,051
Do you have any idea when this was?

219
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,102
Probably, like, 1850s.

220
00:12:43,103 --> 00:12:45,581
I don't even know if it's
in this freaking country.

221
00:12:45,582 --> 00:12:49,122
He felt betrayed, he felt...

222
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:52,019
Double-crossed.

223
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,213
Every time I encountered that man,

224
00:12:54,214 --> 00:12:58,426
I would get a clearer picture of
why he wanted to torture the living.

225
00:12:58,427 --> 00:13:00,884
But the extremes he
took were so dangerous,

226
00:13:00,885 --> 00:13:06,785
it seemed like he didn't care that he
was also putting himself in harm's way.

227
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:11,611
Why would he haunt?

228
00:13:12,245 --> 00:13:15,387
And be trying to get revenge?

229
00:13:15,388 --> 00:13:19,171
They're cursed, really. They're cursed.

230
00:13:20,803 --> 00:13:22,663
Yes.

231
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:23,951
Up next...

232
00:13:23,952 --> 00:13:25,820
And is it safe for your
children in this house?

233
00:13:25,821 --> 00:13:28,296
What happened after the investigation?

234
00:13:28,297 --> 00:13:30,202
I felt like I was gonna hyperventilate

235
00:13:30,203 --> 00:13:32,600
because I had no idea
what was in my house.

236
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:35,029
Spirits be gone.

237
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,598
You are not wanted here.

238
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:40,079
Pass through. You are over.

239
00:13:59,975 --> 00:14:01,958
This is Fred and Jessee.

240
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:04,203
The night of the
reveal, I was so nervous.

241
00:14:04,204 --> 00:14:05,798
I felt like I was gonna hyperventilate

242
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:09,510
because I had no idea what she
was gonna tell me was in my house.

243
00:14:09,511 --> 00:14:11,987
What's most disturbing is
they got three small children,

244
00:14:11,988 --> 00:14:17,088
and two of them are
starting to have experiences.

245
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:22,148
When I walked in the house, I felt
illnesses were in the living room.

246
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:28,049
Then when I went in the pink
room, I felt it really strongly.

247
00:14:28,222 --> 00:14:30,697
That's my daughter's room.

248
00:14:30,698 --> 00:14:34,778
She's been sick for two years now.

249
00:14:35,596 --> 00:14:38,264
And they just couldn't find
anything wrong with her.

250
00:14:38,265 --> 00:14:43,136
I don't want to think that something
in our home would hurt my child.

251
00:14:43,137 --> 00:14:45,806
And it's not that I don't believe Amy.

252
00:14:45,807 --> 00:14:50,307
It's just I don't want to believe that.

253
00:14:50,813 --> 00:14:52,663
What else did you see?

254
00:14:52,664 --> 00:14:54,726
I saw an old man in the house.

255
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,139
He's just, like, confused,
his favorite spot...

256
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,400
Is in the closet in the back bedroom.

257
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,003
He hides in there.

258
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,855
That's my son's room.

259
00:15:07,856 --> 00:15:10,763
He's 6. He's never slept
a full night in his bed.

260
00:15:10,764 --> 00:15:12,400
Wow.

261
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:16,661
It validates everything he says to me.

262
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,150
Well, there was a guy that
lived here for 51 years.

263
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,224
His name was Louis Brunk.

264
00:15:21,225 --> 00:15:24,585
At the end, he
psychologically wasn't right.

265
00:15:24,586 --> 00:15:26,427
And he would say, there's people here.

266
00:15:26,428 --> 00:15:28,749
They're bothering me,
they're talking to me.

267
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:33,201
I did a sketch of a man I think
you're going to want to see.

268
00:15:33,202 --> 00:15:35,924
He's probably about 80...

269
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:39,465
Very sick, very, very frail.

270
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:45,199
You guys tell me.

271
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,841
Wow.

272
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:54,037
That's crazy.

273
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:57,049
I think it's him.

274
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,340
When we first saw the picture of Louis.

275
00:16:00,341 --> 00:16:05,463
It was heartbreaking because he just
looks so sad, and he looks hopeless.

276
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:10,974
And it also validated why we always just
got a bad feeling from all of the closets.

277
00:16:10,975 --> 00:16:14,291
His 14-year-old son hung
himself in the basement here.

278
00:16:14,292 --> 00:16:16,692
My God.

279
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,714
That's who I saw in my dream.

280
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:26,217
The second I saw that picture, I
knew immediately that it was him.

281
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:29,949
As a mother, it affected me
more because I could never

282
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,876
fathom the idea of something like that
happening to one of my own children.

283
00:16:33,877 --> 00:16:38,137
And then not being able to pass over.

284
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:42,524
When I got here, behind me...

285
00:16:42,525 --> 00:16:45,939
Was what I initially thought...

286
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,434
Was a shadow person.

287
00:16:47,435 --> 00:16:52,192
And then I realized that it
was just a male who was hiding.

288
00:16:52,193 --> 00:16:56,933
This guy is very capable
of inflicting pain.

289
00:16:58,397 --> 00:17:00,724
He was from another country.

290
00:17:00,725 --> 00:17:03,094
And he felt...

291
00:17:03,095 --> 00:17:04,340
Like...

292
00:17:04,341 --> 00:17:06,203
He had been double-crossed.

293
00:17:06,204 --> 00:17:10,044
And he became extremely vengeful.

294
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,952
The guy Amy was describing
sounded just like Louis Roesch,

295
00:17:13,953 --> 00:17:18,225
a German immigrant who got
screwed over in a land deal.

296
00:17:18,226 --> 00:17:23,574
Basically, he was betrayed by
the people he gave his money to.

297
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,856
Our findings matched up perfectly,

298
00:17:25,857 --> 00:17:31,633
but the next thing Amy found was
definitely out of my realm of expertise.

299
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,859
When I went into the Master Bedroom.

300
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,670
What I saw in there was these...

301
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:39,958
Things on the ceiling.

302
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:42,595
And they had, like,
little kind of tentacles.

303
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:47,276
And they become very,
very active at night.

304
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,283
They're shattered aspects of the
people who lived and died here.

305
00:17:53,284 --> 00:17:56,075
It's kind of hard to visualize
what I'm talking about so,

306
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:59,796
the sketch artist did draw it.

307
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,340
Take a look at that.

308
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:07,625
My God.

309
00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:16,394
Does it remind you of a dream you had?

310
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,964
That's exactly where it
was. That whole shape.

311
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:23,491
Absolutely, To the T.,
that's how I felt afterwards.

312
00:18:23,492 --> 00:18:24,979
Exact placement.

313
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,874
When I seen the sketch, I was so
tripped out, it was unbelievable.

314
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,768
I'm like, man, this is real.

315
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:36,215
This guy Louis, the one from Germany...

316
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:40,318
Wants these things to become an entity.

317
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,372
So he'd get more powerful.

318
00:18:42,373 --> 00:18:47,391
He would be able to control them
and also feed off of their energy.

319
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:50,141
Honestly, I don't even
know what to do with this.

320
00:18:50,142 --> 00:18:55,002
What he did was he
actually cursed this land.

321
00:18:55,255 --> 00:19:00,138
But when he did this curse,
he actually cursed himself.

322
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,672
He can't get out.

323
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,488
But since he can't get out,

324
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:09,167
he's gonna continue to create
problems or illness or misery.

325
00:19:09,168 --> 00:19:12,167
If you're gonna pick on somebody,
why are you picking on my daughter?

326
00:19:12,168 --> 00:19:14,785
Why are you picking on
my kids? Come after me.

327
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:18,506
It pissed me off. It was bad.

328
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,188
The pressing question is,

329
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:26,565
is it safe for you to raise
your children in this house?

330
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:29,767
You have a lot of dead
around this location.

331
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:34,508
What I feel needs to
be done here is to...

332
00:19:34,955 --> 00:19:38,135
Contact a local Wiccan.

333
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,433
Wiccans are, like, a natural witch.

334
00:19:41,434 --> 00:19:44,890
Will the Wiccan take
care of the bad Louis,

335
00:19:44,891 --> 00:19:48,795
this fractured stuff,
and our poor guy here?

336
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:50,145
Yes.

337
00:19:50,146 --> 00:19:54,046
And it'll protect them from his...

338
00:19:54,047 --> 00:19:55,960
Vengeful curse.

339
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:59,681
Are you gonna take her advice?

340
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:15,546
Fred was immediately ready to
bring the Wiccan into the house.

341
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:20,022
I, on the other hand,
was a little hesitant.

342
00:20:20,023 --> 00:20:21,752
It didn't go with our religion.

343
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,512
I mean, it really upset a
lot of people in my family...

344
00:20:24,513 --> 00:20:29,227
That we're Catholic and we don't
believe in what was presented to us.

345
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:34,388
But if that's what Amy
told me, I was doing it.

346
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,237
Spirits be gone.

347
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,239
You are not wanted here.

348
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,740
Leave this family.

349
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,875
Leave this home. This is not your house.

350
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:49,284
When she came in, I was really hoping
that, this is it. This is the end.

351
00:20:49,285 --> 00:20:52,293
Death has become of
you. You need to relieve.

352
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:56,187
It's a very surreal feeling to have a
Wiccan in the middle of your living room...

353
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:59,668
Pass through. You are over.

354
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,227
And burning Sage around
your entire house...

355
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:06,431
Guardians of the East,
bless us with your presence.

356
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,968
And blessing the backyard
and the whole property.

357
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:15,369
Help us bless this house
and rid it of evil spirits.

358
00:21:23,752 --> 00:21:28,554
Since the Wiccan has been here,
everything is calmer and it's quieter.

359
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:31,722
And we haven't had any more experiences.

360
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,955
My children are feeling much better.

361
00:21:33,956 --> 00:21:36,378
They've all started to
sleep in their own rooms.

362
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:41,866
And my daughter's health is
great, and she's doing great.

363
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:45,353
I am still a little bit leery
that there's something lurking

364
00:21:45,354 --> 00:21:50,034
because it just seems
too good to be true.

365
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:55,263
Although I'm hopeful that
the curse has been lifted,

366
00:21:55,264 --> 00:21:58,316
I completely understand
Jessee's apprehension.

367
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,784
After what she's been through,

368
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:05,685
it'll take time for her to
finally feel safe in her own home.

369
00:22:17,189 --> 00:22:18,975
When I got the call from Anthony,

370
00:22:18,976 --> 00:22:22,773
the bouncer at Smalley's Inn in
Carmel, New York, he sounded terrified.

371
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,958
He'd had some rough
paranormal encounters,

372
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:28,373
and the owner, Tony,
wasn't doing much about it.

373
00:22:28,374 --> 00:22:31,616
Looking back, I'm not only shocked
at what Amy and I uncovered,

374
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:37,517
but blown away by how it all turned out for
the two tough guys at the center of it all.

375
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:43,961
What's going on here?

376
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:46,217
A lot of things are happening here.

377
00:22:46,218 --> 00:22:48,599
I've seen apparitions.

378
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,923
I've seen things getting
pushed off a table.

379
00:22:50,924 --> 00:22:53,237
I've been shoved from behind.

380
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,725
- You're kidding.
- Swear to God.

381
00:22:54,726 --> 00:22:57,866
I hate to say that
I'm scared, but, yeah.

382
00:22:57,867 --> 00:23:01,593
I grew up in the streets of the Bronx,
and I had a gun pointed at my head,

383
00:23:01,594 --> 00:23:04,482
but it's when you can't see the
stuff that will drive you crazy.

384
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:07,585
You don't want to walk through
the door to come to work.

385
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:10,113
When somebody says a place
is haunted, people say,

386
00:23:10,114 --> 00:23:12,756
get out of here. You're
imagining it. You're a lunatic.

387
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:15,263
I honestly started
thinking that I was nuts,

388
00:23:15,264 --> 00:23:19,019
but meeting Steve, it was like
going back to the block again.

389
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:24,012
And I knew he wouldn't think that
I was lying and that I'm not nuts.

390
00:23:24,013 --> 00:23:26,003
So this is actually hurting your income.

391
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:28,824
Yes, I need to support
my wife and three kids.

392
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:32,785
I can't afford to lose this job.

393
00:23:45,888 --> 00:23:51,028
Before I arrived at the location,
I was already feeling on edge.

394
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,133
I saw...

395
00:23:53,134 --> 00:23:57,034
This female, and I've seen her before.

396
00:23:57,035 --> 00:24:01,705
At home, she was, like,
white and transparent.

397
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:03,474
She's here.

398
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:06,341
That dead woman had visited
me days before my walk,

399
00:24:06,342 --> 00:24:10,581
and as soon as I saw her
there, I knew I was in danger.

400
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:13,582
She really hates me.

401
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,015
She seems to cause...

402
00:24:20,173 --> 00:24:22,153
Death.

403
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,496
Whoom! I got tossed.

404
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:28,299
- Next...
- She's happy causing chaos.

405
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,868
A dark presence lurks underground.

406
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:34,589
She really hates living people.

407
00:24:35,214 --> 00:24:38,334
I see pools of blood.

408
00:24:51,721 --> 00:24:53,537
When the bouncer at Smalley's Inn

409
00:24:53,538 --> 00:24:55,907
started telling me about
his paranormal encounters.

410
00:24:55,908 --> 00:24:59,821
My first instinct was to tell him to get
the hell out of there and never come back.

411
00:24:59,822 --> 00:25:01,882
But he needed that job.

412
00:25:01,883 --> 00:25:05,768
And the case was just getting started.

413
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:07,622
All right, so, what
happened to you down here?

414
00:25:07,623 --> 00:25:10,656
I came down here, and a woman
that was very, like, proper,

415
00:25:10,657 --> 00:25:12,693
whispered something in my ear.

416
00:25:12,694 --> 00:25:16,730
I turned around, and...
whoom!... I got tossed.

417
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:18,291
I mean, God, I'm a big guy.

418
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:21,278
Yeah, I mean, I go 210. You got
to be at least 275, 280, right?

419
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,736
Easy. Easy.

420
00:25:22,737 --> 00:25:25,406
This thing threw me like
I was light as a feather.

421
00:25:25,407 --> 00:25:28,884
Any time I go into the
basement, I feel nervous.

422
00:25:28,885 --> 00:25:32,508
That it's gonna happen again to
me... that I'm gonna get thrown again.

423
00:25:32,509 --> 00:25:34,697
Describe the way the woman looked.

424
00:25:34,698 --> 00:25:39,043
She was dressed like an 1800s
look, and I could see through her.

425
00:25:39,044 --> 00:25:40,794
What did you do?

426
00:25:40,795 --> 00:25:43,052
I took off like a bat out of hell.

427
00:25:43,053 --> 00:25:44,913
Wow.

428
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:52,111
She cries.

429
00:25:52,883 --> 00:25:54,568
Really nasty.

430
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:56,789
She is...

431
00:25:56,836 --> 00:25:58,837
What...

432
00:25:58,838 --> 00:26:01,475
People would call a Banshee.

433
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:04,907
Seeing a Banshee is a rare
and terrifying encounter.

434
00:26:04,908 --> 00:26:07,748
To look one in the eye
can be an omen of death.

435
00:26:07,749 --> 00:26:13,389
So when I caught a glimpse,
I thought I was in trouble.

436
00:26:15,524 --> 00:26:18,892
She's happy causing chaos.

437
00:26:18,893 --> 00:26:22,613
She really hates living people.

438
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:26,765
It's really strange.

439
00:26:26,766 --> 00:26:29,349
I think she's here.

440
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,330
Where?

441
00:26:34,642 --> 00:26:36,922
Downstairs.

442
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,486
Well, what else have you see down here?

443
00:26:40,487 --> 00:26:44,332
I've seen a male apparition,
and the same ****

444
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:49,430
I came down here to get some
liquor, and I almost bumped into him.

445
00:26:49,431 --> 00:26:51,725
Like, I thought it was a customer.

446
00:26:51,726 --> 00:26:53,694
Can you describe the guy to me?

447
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:57,184
Yes. Curly white hair, jacket...

448
00:26:57,185 --> 00:26:59,381
Ruffles in the shirt.

449
00:26:59,382 --> 00:27:02,069
And I'm ready to pop him.
I'm ready to smash this guy.

450
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:05,074
And he went that way. I went after him.

451
00:27:05,075 --> 00:27:07,175
Nothing.

452
00:27:07,203 --> 00:27:08,470
Gone.

453
00:27:08,471 --> 00:27:12,679
If that happened to me, I don't know if I
could even come back down in the basement.

454
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,981
Well, I don't.

455
00:27:13,982 --> 00:27:19,882
And there goes my pay, and there
goes putting food on the table.

456
00:27:26,861 --> 00:27:30,203
There's a man in uniform down here.

457
00:27:30,204 --> 00:27:33,099
What kind of uniform?

458
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:39,000
He's wearing, like, a poufy
outfit with a rifle, with a...

459
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,308
Can cut... kill you.

460
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:45,569
Like a knife on the end?

461
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:49,680
But I don't feel good about it.

462
00:27:50,685 --> 00:27:54,555
It feels like maybe the
basement's his area or something.

463
00:27:54,556 --> 00:27:57,613
The amount of activity in that
basement was out of control.

464
00:27:57,614 --> 00:28:00,976
And whenever that many dominant
entities gather in one place,

465
00:28:00,977 --> 00:28:04,937
the living are in serious trouble.

466
00:28:06,701 --> 00:28:08,794
He follows people. He
likes to intimidate.

467
00:28:08,795 --> 00:28:12,973
It's all, like, sneak
attacks, though, for him.

468
00:28:12,974 --> 00:28:16,577
He gives off panic and confusion.

469
00:28:16,578 --> 00:28:19,278
Makes me feel...

470
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,860
Scared.

471
00:28:27,156 --> 00:28:30,608
Anthony said he wasn't the only one
frightened to work at the restaurant.

472
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:34,112
So I decided the only way to find
out how bad things really were...

473
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:37,893
Was to go straight to the top.

474
00:28:42,204 --> 00:28:44,838
People have gotten
tugged on their sleeves,

475
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:48,242
pulled on their aprons,
tapped on the shoulder.

476
00:28:48,243 --> 00:28:50,428
Whenever I'm hiring staff members,

477
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:54,435
I have to tell them that
the place is haunted, and...

478
00:28:54,436 --> 00:28:56,239
"Are you okay with that"?

479
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,245
And a lot of them will
want to come to work and,

480
00:28:59,246 --> 00:29:02,323
they're usually the ones that
leave because they had an incident.

481
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,425
People are quitting
on me left and right.

482
00:29:04,426 --> 00:29:08,829
A girl, she noticed a soldier
standing there looking at her.

483
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,765
So, did she describe what she saw?

484
00:29:10,766 --> 00:29:15,336
A blue uniform with a yellow stripe
going down the side of the pants.

485
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:18,138
So a Civil War or an older army uniform.

486
00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:19,240
Yes.

487
00:29:19,241 --> 00:29:22,601
The girl quit that night.

488
00:29:22,877 --> 00:29:25,944
I just got, like,
this really angry male.

489
00:29:25,945 --> 00:29:27,647
Very intimidating.

490
00:29:27,648 --> 00:29:33,548
I don't know. He came up behind me
and was, like, trying to grab my back.

491
00:29:36,124 --> 00:29:40,024
It feels like this soldier guy...

492
00:29:40,318 --> 00:29:43,372
Or Captain, whatever he is, is hiding.

493
00:29:43,373 --> 00:29:45,210
Do you know where he went?

494
00:29:45,211 --> 00:29:47,011
No.

495
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:53,269
It feels very claustrophobic, like
you can't see your way out to escape.

496
00:29:54,909 --> 00:29:57,139
He had a mortuary underneath the Inn.

497
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,158
Next...

498
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,047
And, like, someone's digging
a bullet out of somebody.

499
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:03,850
Amy unearths a dark secret.

500
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:07,991
It's gross and dirty and disgusting.

501
00:30:22,373 --> 00:30:23,913
According to our clients,

502
00:30:23,914 --> 00:30:27,220
Smalley's Inn was a hotbed of
violent paranormal activity.

503
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:30,532
But nothing they gave me
translated into a solid lead.

504
00:30:30,533 --> 00:30:32,831
So I found someone who
could tell me about the man

505
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:37,632
whose name was written
all over the building.

506
00:30:45,682 --> 00:30:48,470
As you know, I'm doing the
investigation on Smalley's Inn.

507
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:53,631
James Smalley
bought the building in 1852.

508
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:58,961
And he turned it into an inn,
a tavern, and a restaurant.

509
00:30:58,962 --> 00:31:00,855
Okay.

510
00:31:00,856 --> 00:31:05,540
By all accounts, he was quite
active in the community...

511
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:09,457
Town Supervisor, Sheriff,
Treasurer, Assemblyman.

512
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:13,008
He even recruited
soldiers for The Civil War.

513
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:15,244
So, did James Smalley have a family?

514
00:31:15,245 --> 00:31:16,578
Yes.

515
00:31:16,579 --> 00:31:20,517
His first wife was named
Harriett, but she died in 1850.

516
00:31:20,518 --> 00:31:25,258
And then he married
Harriet's sister, Emily.

517
00:31:26,326 --> 00:31:27,689
Do we know when he died?

518
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:32,070
He died in 1867 in the building itself.

519
00:31:32,561 --> 00:31:34,763
He was about 54.

520
00:31:34,764 --> 00:31:40,664
One morning, he woke up, had a
heart attack, and that was it.

521
00:31:46,435 --> 00:31:49,493
I also get this guy.

522
00:31:49,494 --> 00:31:52,280
I don't know if he worked
here or owned the place,

523
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:58,101
but he was very much in charge
and was here all the time.

524
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:03,550
And he also is more, like, residual.

525
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:06,861
But he died here.

526
00:32:06,862 --> 00:32:11,033
When I encounter a residual haunting,
it's rarely a cause for concern.

527
00:32:11,034 --> 00:32:15,137
Instead of being interactive, it's more
like watching a scene from an old movie...

528
00:32:15,138 --> 00:32:19,553
In this case, a very
sad, heartbreaking movie.

529
00:32:19,554 --> 00:32:21,883
And how did he die?

530
00:32:21,884 --> 00:32:25,306
I think he had a heart attack.

531
00:32:25,307 --> 00:32:28,728
When Linda told me about John
Smalley's involvement in The Civil War,

532
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:30,190
a light went off.

533
00:32:30,191 --> 00:32:34,498
An ex-employee at the restaurant claimed
she'd seen a ghost in a Civil War uniform.

534
00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:40,399
With that in mind, I found a military
expert to see if any of this tied together.

535
00:32:47,934 --> 00:32:51,460
I learned that James Smalley was
pretty active during The Civil War.

536
00:32:51,461 --> 00:32:53,409
He was extremely
active in The Civil War.

537
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:57,846
He handled the draft boards, got the
young people from the County to enlist.

538
00:32:57,847 --> 00:33:00,582
Okay, so his role was to actually
get the men to go off and fight.

539
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:02,443
Yes.

540
00:33:03,752 --> 00:33:06,688
Did Smalley actually serve in the war?

541
00:33:06,689 --> 00:33:08,983
He was too old to serve in the war.

542
00:33:08,984 --> 00:33:10,868
So, Rich, did he serve any other way?

543
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:12,220
Yes, he did.

544
00:33:12,221 --> 00:33:15,410
He actually had a mortuary
underneath the Inn.

545
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:16,934
Now, that was in the basement?

546
00:33:16,935 --> 00:33:18,795
Yes.

547
00:33:19,718 --> 00:33:23,328
Soldiers that died of their wounds
in hospitals who were shipped home

548
00:33:23,329 --> 00:33:27,263
for burial were put up temporarily
in his Morgue beneath the Inn.

549
00:33:27,264 --> 00:33:29,184
Okay.

550
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:41,356
Again, just getting this,
like, loud... people yelling.

551
00:33:41,357 --> 00:33:44,717
This is a long time ago.

552
00:33:46,029 --> 00:33:50,978
It is weird, though, because
I do see, like, pools of blood.

553
00:33:50,979 --> 00:33:54,279
- Where?
- On the floor.

554
00:33:56,939 --> 00:34:02,839
The blood on the floor is, like, an
indicator of how many people died here.

555
00:34:05,822 --> 00:34:08,230
As if that restaurant
couldn't have gotten any worse,

556
00:34:08,231 --> 00:34:11,312
now blood was streaming towards my feet.

557
00:34:11,313 --> 00:34:14,608
But unlike other cases where
it's from a senseless killing,

558
00:34:14,609 --> 00:34:18,989
that blood was caused by something else.

559
00:34:20,563 --> 00:34:23,598
And someone's talking
about something medical.

560
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,133
What do you mean?

561
00:34:28,046 --> 00:34:31,286
I'm seeing tables here.

562
00:34:31,774 --> 00:34:36,244
There's a lot of people
here, and there's...

563
00:34:36,245 --> 00:34:38,645
My God!

564
00:34:39,248 --> 00:34:41,616
They're bringing in these men.

565
00:34:41,617 --> 00:34:45,053
People are freaking out,
and they've been injured.

566
00:34:45,054 --> 00:34:49,491
And, like, someone's digging
a bullet out of somebody.

567
00:34:49,492 --> 00:34:53,632
It's gross and dirty and disgusting.

568
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:55,628
Coming up next...

569
00:34:55,629 --> 00:34:57,165
She's there.

570
00:34:57,166 --> 00:35:00,102
The danger becomes real.

571
00:35:00,103 --> 00:35:03,305
She hates all living
people. She's pissed off.

572
00:35:03,306 --> 00:35:05,940
But did they listen to Amy?

573
00:35:05,941 --> 00:35:11,581
I was looking to get out of
Carmel as fast as possible.

574
00:35:35,106 --> 00:35:37,349
Anthony here works
Security for the restaurant.

575
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,230
He's a tough kid.

576
00:35:39,231 --> 00:35:43,269
But he's pretty frightened by some of
the things that have happened to him here.

577
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,324
The night that I met Amy, I was nervous

578
00:35:45,325 --> 00:35:47,673
because she sees dead
people, for Christ's sake.

579
00:35:47,674 --> 00:35:50,969
But I was praying to God that
she actually did find something...

580
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:55,648
That I'm not a lunatic and that I
don't need to go to a mental hospital.

581
00:35:55,649 --> 00:35:57,011
Tony owns the place.

582
00:35:57,012 --> 00:36:00,310
He's concerned about maybe losing
customers because of what's going on here.

583
00:36:00,311 --> 00:36:03,115
So, with that, Amy will start
and tell us about her walk.

584
00:36:03,116 --> 00:36:07,617
Well, there was something I
encountered before the walk.

585
00:36:07,618 --> 00:36:12,118
I was at home, and the female showed up.

586
00:36:12,181 --> 00:36:14,064
And I get here...

587
00:36:14,065 --> 00:36:16,793
And she's there.

588
00:36:16,794 --> 00:36:19,731
And she wants me dead, and...

589
00:36:19,732 --> 00:36:21,431
So you're saying she's here.

590
00:36:21,432 --> 00:36:22,432
Yeah.

591
00:36:22,433 --> 00:36:25,124
- Geez.
- And I'm like, okay.

592
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:27,858
She hates all living
people. She's pissed off.

593
00:36:27,859 --> 00:36:33,139
And I could see through
her, which is really weird.

594
00:36:34,712 --> 00:36:36,813
Have you ever heard of a Banshee?

595
00:36:36,814 --> 00:36:37,822
I've heard the term.

596
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:40,883
A Banshee is, like...

597
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:43,568
A Grim Reaper.

598
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:48,549
If somebody sees them,
that person's gonna die.

599
00:36:48,617 --> 00:36:54,517
If somebody hears them, someone close
to that person is going to die very soon.

600
00:36:55,498 --> 00:36:58,268
And she'll go around the
area. It's not just here.

601
00:36:58,269 --> 00:37:00,218
She's affecting other
locations around here.

602
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:03,974
So that's good. I could take this
woman to my house with my kids, right?

603
00:37:03,975 --> 00:37:06,495
Yes, you can.

604
00:37:08,012 --> 00:37:12,139
I was nervous as all hell, because
I could bring it home to my children.

605
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,939
And that's the only
thing in this whole world

606
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,186
that I really care about, is my babies.

607
00:37:16,187 --> 00:37:20,944
You know, I was looking to get
out of Carmel as fast as possible.

608
00:37:20,945 --> 00:37:24,665
Well, actually, I sketched her.

609
00:37:28,022 --> 00:37:30,422
My God.

610
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:40,610
It's not really like a sketch
I've seen you do before.

611
00:37:40,611 --> 00:37:43,641
Well, she was transparent.

612
00:37:43,642 --> 00:37:47,087
The woman I saw
downstairs was transparent.

613
00:37:47,088 --> 00:37:49,819
I could see through her.

614
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:54,667
I went nuts when I saw that sketch because
that's the woman I saw in the basement.

615
00:37:54,668 --> 00:37:57,785
I wanted to run out of there like
I was Secretariat at the Belmont.

616
00:37:57,786 --> 00:37:59,762
It was that scary.

617
00:37:59,763 --> 00:38:01,979
Her eyes were just all white.

618
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:06,360
You're almost, like, describing a witch.

619
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:09,600
That's a scary-looking picture.

620
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:12,307
When I first saw the sketch it was,

621
00:38:12,308 --> 00:38:14,310
like something you would
see in a horror movie.

622
00:38:14,311 --> 00:38:17,791
And it was all kind of
hitting me at the point where,

623
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:20,326
I was afraid to look over
my shoulder, thinking that...

624
00:38:20,327 --> 00:38:24,054
This Banshee was gonna
be sitting behind me.

625
00:38:24,055 --> 00:38:26,022
What else did you see on your walk?

626
00:38:26,023 --> 00:38:30,376
I encountered a big
guy who had dark hair.

627
00:38:30,377 --> 00:38:35,090
And I got that he was
an owner of this place.

628
00:38:35,091 --> 00:38:36,582
And he had a heart attack.

629
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:38,357
- You saw that?
- Yeah.

630
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:41,071
And then I saw these
men were brought in.

631
00:38:41,072 --> 00:38:45,792
They were bloody, messed
up. The room was disgusting.

632
00:38:45,793 --> 00:38:49,339
It sounds like one of the original
owners, who this place is named after...

633
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,395
James Smalley.

634
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:55,372
He died of what they called
a sudden morning heart attack.

635
00:38:55,373 --> 00:38:58,493
During The Civil War, the
basement acted as the Morgue

636
00:38:58,494 --> 00:39:01,757
for the soldiers that were
getting ready for burial.

637
00:39:03,117 --> 00:39:09,017
Now, his first wife died, and he
wound up marrying her sister, Emily.

638
00:39:13,607 --> 00:39:16,307
I heard and seen this lady.

639
00:39:16,308 --> 00:39:18,440
You saw her?

640
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:21,501
I saw her downstairs.

641
00:39:21,784 --> 00:39:23,746
One of the reasons we're here...

642
00:39:23,747 --> 00:39:27,617
He was in the basement,
and he got shoved.

643
00:39:27,618 --> 00:39:31,255
I got flung like it was nothing.

644
00:39:31,256 --> 00:39:35,325
Well, I felt, when I saw
this photo, that it was her.

645
00:39:35,326 --> 00:39:37,790
I breathed a sigh of relief because now

646
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:40,096
I knew we weren't
dealing with a Banshee.

647
00:39:40,097 --> 00:39:42,865
It was only a projection
created by that woman.

648
00:39:42,866 --> 00:39:47,666
But that didn't make
her any less dangerous.

649
00:39:47,971 --> 00:39:51,324
Well, Anthony, Tony, there's
obviously stuff going on here.

650
00:39:51,325 --> 00:39:54,045
The question is, is it
safe for you to be here?

651
00:39:54,046 --> 00:39:58,486
She is your first priority to deal with.

652
00:39:58,949 --> 00:40:02,407
And it's not gonna be easy.

653
00:40:02,408 --> 00:40:07,710
Find a priest, and you need
a medium at the same time.

654
00:40:07,711 --> 00:40:10,102
The medium is basically...

655
00:40:10,103 --> 00:40:13,583
Going to ask her to leave.

656
00:40:14,165 --> 00:40:16,892
The priest is gonna do a blessing.

657
00:40:16,893 --> 00:40:21,693
And that's going to
help with him to leave.

658
00:40:21,972 --> 00:40:27,072
Well, are you guys gonna
listen to Amy's advice?

659
00:40:39,448 --> 00:40:42,640
After the investigation, I didn't
come back here for a month or two.

660
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:47,422
I still didn't think it
was safe to work here.

661
00:40:47,423 --> 00:40:52,703
After Amy had left, paranormal
activity did increase.

662
00:40:53,571 --> 00:40:55,431
But so did business.

663
00:40:55,432 --> 00:40:58,492
So I can't complain.

664
00:40:58,698 --> 00:41:02,412
I need this job to support
my three kids and my wife.

665
00:41:02,413 --> 00:41:06,749
I need to pay my bills, but
I cut back my hours big-time.

666
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,518
I only work fridays now.

667
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:14,419
And it's because I'm not gonna
have myself thrown downstairs.

668
00:41:14,758 --> 00:41:17,560
These ghosts have become,
like, our trademark here.

669
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:21,698
And people know us as the
haunted restaurant in Carmel.

670
00:41:21,699 --> 00:41:23,999
So do I want to get rid of them?

671
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,176
No.

672
00:41:25,177 --> 00:41:27,217
Cheers.

673
00:41:28,556 --> 00:41:30,310
Tony's one of my best friends,

674
00:41:30,311 --> 00:41:34,410
but does he care about his
business more than our friendship?

675
00:41:34,411 --> 00:41:35,811
Sure, he does.

676
00:41:35,812 --> 00:41:40,383
It's a restaurant.
This is his livelihood.

677
00:41:40,384 --> 00:41:43,605
People will come up to me and tell
me I have to get rid of the ghosts

678
00:41:43,606 --> 00:41:47,746
because something bad's gonna happen.

679
00:41:48,508 --> 00:41:51,339
I'm worried about people's
safety when they come in here.

680
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,229
These ghosts are here for a reason.

681
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:56,601
They were here before us.
This is their territory.

682
00:41:56,602 --> 00:42:00,603
And they're gonna lash out,
and they're gonna harm somebody.

683
00:42:00,604 --> 00:42:05,164
Until that time, I'm gonna do it my way.

684
00:42:05,769 --> 00:42:08,740
I'm disappointed in Tony for
deciding that making money

685
00:42:08,741 --> 00:42:11,486
is more important than his
staff and customers' safety.

686
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:16,252
And that Anthony continues to put
himself at risk because he needs the job.

687
00:42:16,253 --> 00:42:19,259
I warned Tony that he was
dealing with something dangerous,

688
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:22,530
and my guess is that one
day, I'll hear from him again.
