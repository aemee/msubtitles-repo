1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:11,457 --> 00:00:14,369
Something is not right.

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,961
Angry... very angry.

4
00:00:15,962 --> 00:00:18,530
I wake up with scratches.

5
00:00:18,531 --> 00:00:21,199
They're all losing it.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,157
There's a war going on.

7
00:00:23,158 --> 00:00:25,671
I see this thing, like,
whispering in their ear.

8
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:27,409
It's something evil.

9
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,223
They're kind of being possessed.

10
00:00:29,224 --> 00:00:30,966
This is demonic.

11
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:33,244
They're trying to kill me.

12
00:00:33,245 --> 00:00:37,685
They're not safe anywhere in this house.

13
00:00:37,884 --> 00:00:39,618
They're being watched.

14
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:42,739
My name is Amy Allan.

15
00:00:43,122 --> 00:00:45,323
This thing likes death.

16
00:00:45,324 --> 00:00:46,934
I see dead people.

17
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:48,506
This thing's, like, a monster.

18
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,611
I speak to dead people.

19
00:00:50,612 --> 00:00:52,263
And he's pissed off now.

20
00:00:52,264 --> 00:00:53,712
And they speak to me.

21
00:00:53,713 --> 00:00:55,200
His head was cracked.

22
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:58,914
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

23
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:00,138
This guy was murdered.

24
00:01:00,139 --> 00:01:01,813
I rely on my partner.

25
00:01:01,814 --> 00:01:05,169
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

26
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,980
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

27
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:11,198
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

28
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:12,540
You saw her?

29
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:13,853
It's my job to reveal them.

30
00:01:13,854 --> 00:01:15,020
Why would you stay here?

31
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:17,184
But Steve and I never speak...

32
00:01:17,185 --> 00:01:19,314
We never communicate
during an investigation.

33
00:01:19,315 --> 00:01:20,690
Until the very end.

34
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:22,575
Stop it.

35
00:01:22,576 --> 00:01:24,408
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

36
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:26,990
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

37
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:28,274
Or time to get out.

38
00:01:28,275 --> 00:01:33,015
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

39
00:01:49,022 --> 00:01:53,291
It's crucial that Amy and I
conduct separate investigations.

40
00:01:53,292 --> 00:01:56,716
I interview witnesses, research
the history of the location,

41
00:01:56,717 --> 00:02:02,617
and uncover secrets from the
past, while Amy speaks to the dead.

42
00:02:04,285 --> 00:02:06,912
I'm in the small resort
town of Watervliet, Michigan,

43
00:02:06,913 --> 00:02:09,296
a few hours outside of Detroit.

44
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:11,932
Amy and I were called in
by a woman named Amanda.

45
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:14,935
When I spoke to her on the
phone, her message was simple...

46
00:02:14,936 --> 00:02:18,572
You guys need to help me, or
this house is gonna kill me.

47
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:24,473
Obviously, this is a serious situation,
and I'm hoping Amy and I can help her out.

48
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:33,754
Before Amy arrives, I have to clear
the area of any leading information.

49
00:02:33,755 --> 00:02:38,125
I can tell from the photos alone
that a couple with kids live here.

50
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:44,026
So I have to carefully remove any evidence
of this before Amy begins her walk.

51
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:01,471
I'm seeing a lot of physical activity.

52
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:04,354
There's something around that's...

53
00:03:04,355 --> 00:03:06,513
Uh, creepy.

54
00:03:06,514 --> 00:03:12,414
There's a dead person or entity
that's a controller of this location.

55
00:03:13,304 --> 00:03:15,328
I think it might be a child.

56
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:18,735
Something about hidden truth, I think,
was specifically what they said...

57
00:03:18,736 --> 00:03:21,196
Hidden truth.

58
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:36,532
Well, Amanda, you sounded
pretty desperate on the phone,

59
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,185
so why don't you
explain what's happening?

60
00:03:38,186 --> 00:03:40,721
I'm beyond scared for my safety.

61
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:43,492
I'm pretty much scared for my life.

62
00:03:43,493 --> 00:03:48,963
My health has seriously declined since
I moved back here three years ago.

63
00:03:48,964 --> 00:03:52,332
And because of that,
I've put on weight...

64
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:56,134
And about two months
ago, I had a heart attack.

65
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:58,358
- And you're how old now?
- 32.

66
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:00,583
- That's really young for a heart attack.
- It is.

67
00:04:00,584 --> 00:04:03,270
Was it because of the weight gain
that this caused the heart attack,

68
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:05,312
or did the doctor say
what may have caused it?

69
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:10,124
They don't know what caused it. They
did tests, and there was no blockages.

70
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,023
Okay. And what else has happened?

71
00:04:12,024 --> 00:04:14,568
I've been scratched and burned.

72
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:20,110
I'm fearful for myself and for
my boyfriend and for his kids.

73
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:21,389
Are they here all the time?

74
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,831
No, they just come to
visit... usually on weekends.

75
00:04:23,832 --> 00:04:26,016
- Does anybody else live in the house?
- Yes.

76
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:29,402
My mother and a friend of the family
does stay in the basement, as well.

77
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,805
I'm gonna ask the obvious
thing... why are you staying here?

78
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:37,706
I came back to the area because my dad
was sick, and finances are a big problem.

79
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:40,394
What's your biggest concern, then?

80
00:04:40,395 --> 00:04:42,134
Dying.

81
00:04:42,135 --> 00:04:43,751
I feel like they're...

82
00:04:43,752 --> 00:04:46,486
They're systematically
trying to kill me...

83
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:49,907
Whatever is in this house.

84
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:01,770
There's this thing in this
house that's really bad.

85
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:08,672
The people here have no ability to...

86
00:05:09,989 --> 00:05:13,169
Not be influenced by...

87
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:15,249
These dead people.

88
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,098
Like, they can be unhealthy, they
can't take care of themselves,

89
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:22,255
they can't sleep and
can't eat right, and...

90
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:25,569
Because either they eat too
much or they don't eat enough.

91
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,010
They're not safe anywhere in this house.

92
00:05:30,687 --> 00:05:33,167
I started to sense that
the influential presence

93
00:05:33,168 --> 00:05:37,021
in this house was targeting
one person in particular.

94
00:05:37,022 --> 00:05:40,880
This thing can easily
access this person's mind.

95
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:45,741
It can make this person
do anything it wants.

96
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:55,990
So, what's happening in here?

97
00:05:55,991 --> 00:05:59,874
I wake up with scratches
and burns, actually.

98
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:00,995
What do these look like?

99
00:06:00,996 --> 00:06:03,605
I have some pictures
here of some of them.

100
00:06:03,606 --> 00:06:06,786
- Okay.
- You can see.

101
00:06:09,104 --> 00:06:10,809
You just woke up and
that burn was there?

102
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,612
Yeah.

103
00:06:11,613 --> 00:06:14,108
There a candle or anything
that could have did this to you?

104
00:06:14,109 --> 00:06:15,909
No.

105
00:06:16,064 --> 00:06:18,978
And this is none of the animals you're
living with or anything like that?

106
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,877
No, absolutely not.

107
00:06:20,878 --> 00:06:24,163
So, Amanda, looking at this I would imagine
it's got to be tough sleeping at night.

108
00:06:24,164 --> 00:06:28,355
Yeah. Sometimes I find
myself sleepwalking.

109
00:06:28,356 --> 00:06:32,910
I've had bruises on my calves from
where I've run into things, and...

110
00:06:32,911 --> 00:06:35,963
It's, um... it's gotten out of control.

111
00:06:35,964 --> 00:06:38,966
I've developed sleep apnea and insomnia.

112
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:41,396
When I do sleep, I have bad dreams.

113
00:06:41,397 --> 00:06:47,297
I had a dream that we were driving Mike's
kids home and we were hit by a semi.

114
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,750
I see this thing, like, kind of standing
at this person's back, being like...

115
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:59,052
You know, like, whispering in their ear,

116
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:02,256
like, do this or do that,
and the person can't sleep.

117
00:07:02,257 --> 00:07:04,691
And if they sleep, then it's really bad,

118
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:07,460
like invasions in the
sleep or something like...

119
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:09,141
What do you mean?

120
00:07:09,142 --> 00:07:11,563
Maybe it's like a trance state.

121
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:15,669
Like, they're seeing where they're going,
but they don't have any control over it.

122
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,071
You know, and then
they're, like, startled...

123
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:19,884
- Okay...
- Which is really...

124
00:07:19,885 --> 00:07:23,725
Kind of unnerving, uh, because...

125
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:26,880
Well, then they're
kind of being possessed.

126
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:29,101
Possessed.

127
00:07:35,824 --> 00:07:38,926
What's going on in the kitchen?

128
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:43,363
One time, I was just grabbing
something out of the pantry,

129
00:07:43,364 --> 00:07:47,090
and I turned around, and there
was a man standing next to me.

130
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,837
Okay. So, describe him for me.

131
00:07:48,838 --> 00:07:51,972
- He was a little taller than I was, thin.
- Okay.

132
00:07:51,973 --> 00:07:55,664
He had a square jaw
and a button-down shirt.

133
00:07:55,665 --> 00:07:59,385
If you were to see a photo, would you be
able to recognize if it's the same person?

134
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:02,950
Yeah. I think he was trying to warn me
that there's something else in the house.

135
00:08:02,951 --> 00:08:05,510
And that I needed to
do something about it.

136
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:07,431
Okay.

137
00:08:15,196 --> 00:08:18,736
Something is not right here.

138
00:08:19,787 --> 00:08:22,487
This is a male.

139
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,281
And he is not that old.

140
00:08:25,282 --> 00:08:28,642
He is, like, in his 50s.

141
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,945
He's, like...

142
00:08:30,946 --> 00:08:33,766
Angry. Very angry.

143
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:38,083
Something in this
house is wreaking havoc,

144
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,180
but I don't think this angry man
is the one influencing the living.

145
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:43,316
He's not advanced enough.

146
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:46,793
He's just getting pissed
off and beating on the walls.

147
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:48,591
And, like, stomping on the floors.

148
00:08:48,592 --> 00:08:52,065
He's trying to put it back
the way he knows it to be.

149
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:57,966
Like, he's trying to take down the
things that don't make sense to him.

150
00:08:57,979 --> 00:09:03,879
This is where the scariest thing
that I've encountered happened.

151
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:07,385
I felt like I was in
some sort of trance...

152
00:09:07,386 --> 00:09:11,360
And I came out of it, and
I found myself standing...

153
00:09:11,361 --> 00:09:13,812
At the kitchen counter,
spinning a knife.

154
00:09:13,813 --> 00:09:17,204
- Spinning a knife?
- Yes.

155
00:09:17,205 --> 00:09:21,795
I later realized that I was having
a lot of negative thoughts...

156
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:23,363
Suicidal thoughts.

157
00:09:23,364 --> 00:09:26,400
Okay. Now, have you ever
had suicidal thoughts before?

158
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:27,401
No.

159
00:09:27,402 --> 00:09:29,554
Did you ever have it again in the house?

160
00:09:29,555 --> 00:09:30,603
No.

161
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,806
Did you tell your boyfriend about it?

162
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:35,242
- No, I didn't tell anyone.
- Why not?

163
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:37,444
They're already worried for my health.

164
00:09:37,445 --> 00:09:41,292
I don't want them to worry
about me taking my life.

165
00:09:41,293 --> 00:09:45,313
I think that whatever's in here...

166
00:09:45,555 --> 00:09:48,231
Is trying to kill me,
one way or another...

167
00:09:48,232 --> 00:09:54,132
Either through my health or
through making me take my own life.

168
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:00,286
What is this thing?

169
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,133
It feels like...

170
00:10:03,332 --> 00:10:05,492
A child?

171
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:07,907
I feel like...

172
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:10,800
That it would be a girl.

173
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:13,861
12- or 13-year-old.

174
00:10:14,105 --> 00:10:17,885
She looks like a shadow person.

175
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:22,422
She's bad. Whoa!

176
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:24,943
What happened?

177
00:10:26,361 --> 00:10:28,503
This girl...

178
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:30,784
Zapped me.

179
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:34,795
She [Bleep] ran at me.

180
00:10:35,336 --> 00:10:37,471
I didn't expect this at all.

181
00:10:37,472 --> 00:10:41,841
The entity that's tormenting the
people in this house is a little girl.

182
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:45,778
She's pretty strong. She
knows what she's doing.

183
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,215
She took all my energy.

184
00:10:48,216 --> 00:10:53,487
She tries to control all
the people that come here.

185
00:10:53,488 --> 00:10:59,388
I think she's influenced somebody to
either commit suicide or kill someone.

186
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:06,372
So, this room is the room
that I made for Mike's kids.

187
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:07,647
Okay. How old are they?

188
00:11:07,648 --> 00:11:10,634
His son is 11, and his daughter is 12.

189
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:12,433
Have the kids experienced
anything up here?

190
00:11:12,434 --> 00:11:16,234
Just last weekend, Mike's
son had experiences.

191
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:19,679
- What happened?
- He saw red eyes staring at him.

192
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,100
- Where?
- In the hallway.

193
00:11:24,152 --> 00:11:26,780
- Were the dogs up here?
- No. The dogs are never up here.

194
00:11:26,781 --> 00:11:28,776
Amanda, let me ask you a
question, are you worried

195
00:11:28,777 --> 00:11:30,685
that something's gonna
happen to the kids?

196
00:11:30,686 --> 00:11:32,906
Certainly.

197
00:11:36,564 --> 00:11:40,175
This little girl... she's jealous.

198
00:11:40,176 --> 00:11:43,670
Jealousy between this girl and...

199
00:11:43,671 --> 00:11:46,851
And whoever's in here.

200
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,612
Bad. That's not good.

201
00:11:49,613 --> 00:11:52,760
You said that she might
try to influence the living?

202
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:57,441
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you know who that would be?

203
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:00,331
- It's an adult.
- What does she want?

204
00:12:00,332 --> 00:12:03,223
To make her kill them.

205
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:05,444
Kill who?

206
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:09,327
Whoever's in this room.

207
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:38,482
So, Mike, I spoke with Amanda, and she
explained what's going on in the house.

208
00:12:38,483 --> 00:12:39,699
And her concerns.

209
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,935
- Have you had experiences here?
- Yes, I have.

210
00:12:41,936 --> 00:12:44,485
I actually had a few
experiences in the bedroom.

211
00:12:44,486 --> 00:12:47,007
Sleeping at night, I feel like
there's somebody crawling in bed.

212
00:12:47,008 --> 00:12:50,312
I can feel the bed pressing down like
somebody's crawling in bed with me...

213
00:12:50,313 --> 00:12:51,125
Right.

214
00:12:51,126 --> 00:12:53,479
When Amanda will be up in
the living room watching TV.

215
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,682
The first time, it
scared me, and it happened

216
00:12:55,683 --> 00:12:57,502
for about two weeks
after that... every night.

217
00:12:57,503 --> 00:13:00,386
Did it feel like a human or maybe one
of the dogs? What did it feel like?

218
00:13:00,387 --> 00:13:01,788
It felt like a human.

219
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:03,379
Okay. Anything else?

220
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,076
I've heard, actually, a voice.

221
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:07,861
Again, we were in there,
watching TV again at night,

222
00:13:07,862 --> 00:13:10,430
and I heard somebody
whisper, how you doing?

223
00:13:10,431 --> 00:13:13,233
And I looked at Amanda. I said,
did you say something to me?

224
00:13:13,234 --> 00:13:14,999
She said, no.

225
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,888
Now, when they said, how you
doing? Was it a female or a...?

226
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:20,649
It was a female.

227
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:29,226
She likes to be as scary as possible...

228
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:34,080
And she's actually pretty good at it.

229
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:36,565
Like, she crawls in bed with this person

230
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:41,606
and acts like it's sleeping
with... this person.

231
00:13:44,098 --> 00:13:47,053
She yells and screams...

232
00:13:47,054 --> 00:13:49,454
And howls...

233
00:13:51,105 --> 00:13:57,005
Which I would think that the living
would probably be able to hear.

234
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,035
It's very scary for me,

235
00:14:04,036 --> 00:14:06,920
because it doesn't seem like I'm
in control when this is happening.

236
00:14:06,921 --> 00:14:09,082
I have had fits of rage.

237
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:13,075
I get mad over the littlest
things... a question being asked.

238
00:14:13,076 --> 00:14:15,728
I'm afraid that I'm gonna
hurt somebody in the house.

239
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,296
- And that's not in your nature?
- No, Sir. No, Sir.

240
00:14:18,297 --> 00:14:20,341
Do you feel it's when you're
here you get like that?

241
00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:21,145
Yes.

242
00:14:21,146 --> 00:14:23,709
That's got to be a strain on your
relationship with Amanda, also.

243
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,737
Yes, it is.

244
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,832
What do you think is
going on in this house?

245
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,838
I think it's something evil.

246
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,810
- Why don't you just move out?
- Because I love her, you know and,

247
00:14:32,811 --> 00:14:38,711
we care for each other and we're
helping each other out through this.

248
00:14:41,122 --> 00:14:43,762
So, the girl...

249
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:48,905
She can go anywhere she
wants to in the house.

250
00:14:48,914 --> 00:14:51,662
She can make them feel agitated.

251
00:14:51,663 --> 00:14:53,498
Attaching herself to them.

252
00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:58,239
Draining their energy,
making them feel sick.

253
00:15:03,044 --> 00:15:06,055
So, Pat, I was talking to your
daughter, and I wanted to talk to you.

254
00:15:06,056 --> 00:15:07,706
- I understand you live here.
- Yeah.

255
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,149
You've been living here a long time.

256
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,162
- Close to 17 years.
- 17 years?

257
00:15:11,163 --> 00:15:13,586
So, have you experienced
anything since you've been here?

258
00:15:13,587 --> 00:15:15,055
No.

259
00:15:15,056 --> 00:15:16,676
Why do you think that is?

260
00:15:16,677 --> 00:15:20,123
I have a relationship with the Lord.

261
00:15:20,124 --> 00:15:23,729
And I think that keeps me from seeing...

262
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:28,170
Or experiencing
anything that is demonic.

263
00:15:28,484 --> 00:15:30,484
And I believe this is demonic.

264
00:15:30,485 --> 00:15:32,617
So, you believe that Amanda
is telling me the truth?

265
00:15:32,618 --> 00:15:34,507
I do, absolutely.

266
00:15:34,508 --> 00:15:38,998
Amanda's at risk right now.
They're warring over her.

267
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:40,913
Why her?

268
00:15:40,914 --> 00:15:44,917
Because I believe that God
has a special purpose for her.

269
00:15:44,918 --> 00:15:47,802
And she hasn't stepped up to it.

270
00:15:47,803 --> 00:15:52,610
And I still try to encourage
her to get back to the faith.

271
00:15:52,611 --> 00:15:55,306
And you believe that if she found
her way back to the church...

272
00:15:55,307 --> 00:15:59,199
It doesn't even have to be church...
just finds her way back to God,

273
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,320
that that would cease.

274
00:16:02,903 --> 00:16:07,007
It's really hard to watch as a parent.

275
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:10,464
I pray that there is a solution.

276
00:16:10,465 --> 00:16:14,545
That she can be the vibrant person.

277
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:16,767
And have the full life...

278
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:20,413
You know, the active
life that she deserves.

279
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:22,801
She already had a heart attack.

280
00:16:22,802 --> 00:16:26,402
You worried about losing her?

281
00:16:26,973 --> 00:16:29,529
It crosses my mind.

282
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,609
I try not to dwell on the negative.

283
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,402
I know that there's a plan.

284
00:16:35,403 --> 00:16:38,138
What are you hoping that Amy
and I can do for your daughter?

285
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:40,940
I really have no expectations.

286
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:45,581
I really don't think that
there's anything that can be done.

287
00:16:45,582 --> 00:16:49,567
It's only the power of the
Lord that's gonna handle it.

288
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:55,468
There's a war going on between
God's Angels and the Devil's Demons.

289
00:17:04,643 --> 00:17:10,543
There's, like, really, really,
really bad, bad things down here.

290
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:14,515
Not where I'd be wanting to be.

291
00:17:17,278 --> 00:17:20,613
What the [Bleep] is this?

292
00:17:20,614 --> 00:17:24,562
This old man putzing around
and being grumpy and...

293
00:17:24,563 --> 00:17:27,685
Just always angry and pissed off and,

294
00:17:27,686 --> 00:17:30,901
just unhappy and miserable
about his life and...

295
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:34,395
Hates that somebody is down here...

296
00:17:34,396 --> 00:17:37,406
Hates that somebody is in its...

297
00:17:37,407 --> 00:17:39,927
In its space.

298
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,653
He um...

299
00:17:43,123 --> 00:17:45,171
Gets angry.

300
00:17:45,172 --> 00:17:48,074
Whoever hangs out
down here is his focus.

301
00:17:48,075 --> 00:17:53,235
And I think he tries to
kill them at some point.

302
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,109
I really feel for Amanda.

303
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:12,779
For her, this investigation
is literally life and death.

304
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,175
Now I'm heading over to
meet with a town historian...

305
00:18:15,176 --> 00:18:21,076
Who says Amanda's property is a
big part of Watervliet's history.

306
00:18:26,734 --> 00:18:28,799
The property you're
investigating, Steve,

307
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,560
was purchased and
developed by Isaac Swain.

308
00:18:32,561 --> 00:18:35,501
In the early 1830s.

309
00:18:36,017 --> 00:18:39,460
In addition, they had
vast holdings of property,

310
00:18:39,461 --> 00:18:44,783
which, at that particular time, was
all undeveloped forests and woodlands.

311
00:18:44,784 --> 00:18:50,684
And you can see where he has his name
on all of these different plots of land.

312
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:55,880
And how much property do
you think he had altogether?

313
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:58,333
Upwards of 900 acres.

314
00:18:58,334 --> 00:19:01,406
How did Swain make his mark
when he was living here?

315
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:02,546
What did he do?

316
00:19:02,547 --> 00:19:05,646
Well, he was renowned
for his lumber mill.

317
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:08,570
He had upwards of 50
employees working for him.

318
00:19:08,571 --> 00:19:11,119
It was the biggest
mill in Berrien County.

319
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,980
Wow.

320
00:19:20,006 --> 00:19:23,182
I'm just seeing, like, woods...

321
00:19:23,183 --> 00:19:26,963
Uh, thick woods, lots of trees.

322
00:19:30,408 --> 00:19:36,201
All I'm getting is somebody, like,
saying, too bad about, you know, the trees.

323
00:19:36,202 --> 00:19:38,678
This little old lady's saying,
like, too bad about the trees,

324
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:43,059
like, that they cut down all the trees.

325
00:19:44,438 --> 00:19:47,907
Daryl knew very little about
Isaac Swain's personal life.

326
00:19:47,908 --> 00:19:50,306
So I'm on my way to meet a local author,

327
00:19:50,307 --> 00:19:56,207
who says Swain's time in Watervliet
was filled with heartbreak.

328
00:20:01,656 --> 00:20:04,323
This guy, Isaac Swain, what
were you able to find out?

329
00:20:04,324 --> 00:20:06,960
Well, Isaac Swain and his
wife came to Watervliet.

330
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:09,663
- And they had three children.
- Okay.

331
00:20:09,664 --> 00:20:11,583
He had a daughter named Martha...

332
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:14,527
- Okay.
- And she died at the age of 15.

333
00:20:14,528 --> 00:20:19,089
- From what?
- Records back then didn't really specify.

334
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:23,429
Then their youngest son,
who was age 3, William,

335
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,687
passes away suddenly.

336
00:20:25,688 --> 00:20:29,864
- Right after she died, or...
- Exactly... within two years.

337
00:20:29,865 --> 00:20:33,987
But it doesn't stop there.
Their second daughter, Louisa...

338
00:20:33,988 --> 00:20:38,347
She had a tragic accident, and it's
hard to tell what exactly happened,

339
00:20:38,348 --> 00:20:42,376
but somewhere between
the ages of 10 and 14,

340
00:20:42,377 --> 00:20:45,513
she fell and hit her head so hard...

341
00:20:45,514 --> 00:20:49,002
That she became mentally disabled.

342
00:20:49,003 --> 00:20:50,375
She was basically an invalid?

343
00:20:50,376 --> 00:20:53,768
She basically was. She
had to have 24-hour care.

344
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:57,102
I assume Isaac and his wife stayed in the
area and took care of the remaining child.

345
00:20:57,103 --> 00:21:02,023
For a while, they did, but, actually,
the wife, Vallonia, started to get sick,

346
00:21:02,024 --> 00:21:06,165
and I actually found a
picture of her for you.

347
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,004
Now, do we know what
kind of illness she had?

348
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:12,728
The symptoms that they described
were somewhat similar to Tuberculosis.

349
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:17,305
It was important to Isaac to make sure
that she had the best care possible.

350
00:21:17,306 --> 00:21:19,914
- You're talking about his wife, Vallonia?
- Yes.

351
00:21:19,915 --> 00:21:22,779
So, what they did for three years...

352
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:27,496
Was travel around the northeast,
actually looking for someone to help them,

353
00:21:27,497 --> 00:21:30,019
doctors... looking for
a different environment...

354
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,938
- Right.
- In hopes that this would help cure her.

355
00:21:32,939 --> 00:21:35,864
- Does she get cured? What happens?
- No. Unfortunately...

356
00:21:35,865 --> 00:21:38,700
She does not get cured, and she...

357
00:21:38,701 --> 00:21:41,461
Succumbs to this.

358
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,986
Would they have taken Louisa with
them on this three-year journey?

359
00:21:46,987 --> 00:21:51,996
Louisa was likely not taken with
them because she needed constant care.

360
00:21:51,997 --> 00:21:56,384
She lived with the staff
people and the caretakers.

361
00:21:56,385 --> 00:21:58,884
There was a certain
amount of stigma associated

362
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:01,600
with somebody with a
mental disability back then.

363
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:03,497
She had no social
interaction whatsoever?

364
00:22:03,498 --> 00:22:04,936
Very little. Very little.

365
00:22:04,937 --> 00:22:07,006
And the only people that she really knew

366
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:09,841
- was her own family and her caretakers.
- Caretakers.

367
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:15,182
And when her family passed
away, she was left alone.

368
00:22:19,052 --> 00:22:22,054
This girl... she died...

369
00:22:22,055 --> 00:22:24,390
Do you know when this was?

370
00:22:24,391 --> 00:22:26,625
A while ago.

371
00:22:26,626 --> 00:22:29,690
Well, I'd say at least 100 years.

372
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:33,532
The young girl that's been
stalking me is extremely powerful.

373
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:38,448
And I'm starting to see what's
causing her to torment the living here.

374
00:22:38,449 --> 00:22:41,907
She has a lot of pain
that she's dealing with.

375
00:22:41,908 --> 00:22:46,588
- A lot of pain?
- Yeah, physical, physical.

376
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,649
And she's not herself.

377
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:54,070
She was mentally not okay.

378
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,423
And she puts it like she
likes to play with people,

379
00:22:57,424 --> 00:23:01,347
because she wasn't allowed to play
with people when she was alive.

380
00:23:01,348 --> 00:23:03,895
Well, and then she was
just screaming at me

381
00:23:03,896 --> 00:23:07,803
through the... you
know, through the wall.

382
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:09,601
She's kind of creepy, though.

383
00:23:09,602 --> 00:23:13,742
She's creeping me out a little bit.

384
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,792
I'm at the local library to see what

385
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:33,689
else I can find out
about Amanda's problem.

386
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:34,917
Digging through the archives,

387
00:23:34,918 --> 00:23:38,497
I uncover an obituary of a
young woman named Sadie Smith.

388
00:23:38,498 --> 00:23:41,318
Who died in 1918.

389
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:46,148
The location of her funeral...

390
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:49,449
My client's living room.

391
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,659
So, not only does a 32-year-old woman
die on the property I'm investigating,

392
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,359
they held her funeral
right inside the house.

393
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,797
I'm on my way to meet with
a local funeral Director

394
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:08,698
who promised to look into the town
records and give me the whole story.

395
00:24:16,985 --> 00:24:20,050
Roland, I know from other
cases, back in the early days,

396
00:24:20,051 --> 00:24:22,517
that people did hold
funerals in their homes.

397
00:24:22,518 --> 00:24:24,405
Now, was that common in this area?

398
00:24:24,406 --> 00:24:27,205
Back in 1918, probably 90% of the time,

399
00:24:27,206 --> 00:24:29,491
funerals were held in the home, yes.

400
00:24:29,492 --> 00:24:33,862
Now, Sadie... it said she died from
influenza, what were you able to find out?

401
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:38,512
Well, I was able to obtain a
copy of the death certificate.

402
00:24:38,513 --> 00:24:42,317
And she obtained Spanish influenza
and had it for about a week,

403
00:24:42,318 --> 00:24:45,953
and then passed away of heart failure.

404
00:24:45,954 --> 00:24:50,445
Possibly, the reason they held the wake
in the house was to contain the influenza.

405
00:24:50,446 --> 00:24:53,148
She was young... 32.
So, she wasn't married?

406
00:24:53,149 --> 00:24:54,649
No, never married.

407
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,402
- No children?
- No children.

408
00:24:56,403 --> 00:24:58,487
So, it had to be tough on
the parents, I would think.

409
00:24:58,488 --> 00:25:01,368
Probably was, yeah.

410
00:25:08,654 --> 00:25:13,399
Something took place here
where people were crying and...

411
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,620
Screaming.

412
00:25:16,505 --> 00:25:18,436
There was a funeral here.

413
00:25:18,437 --> 00:25:22,251
Where they had the
casket, and it was open,

414
00:25:22,252 --> 00:25:25,972
and people were saying goodbye.

415
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,790
This is a young female.

416
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:36,421
They're all crying,
freaking out, just losing it.

417
00:25:39,628 --> 00:25:42,530
So, Roland, what happened with
the parents after Sadie dies?

418
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:44,332
They stayed in the home.

419
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:45,894
Okay. So, she lived with her parents?

420
00:25:45,895 --> 00:25:48,856
Yes, and shortly after
Sadie passed away,

421
00:25:48,857 --> 00:25:53,575
the mother, Evelyn, was in frail health
for about five years and passed away.

422
00:25:53,576 --> 00:25:59,149
Steve, I was able to find the
obituary in the local newspaper on...

423
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,490
Mrs. Smith.

424
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,152
And how old was she when she died?

425
00:26:04,153 --> 00:26:05,519
She was 67.

426
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,489
Did she die of natural causes?

427
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,305
Natural causes there, also...

428
00:26:09,306 --> 00:26:11,860
- From a heart disease.
- Okay.

429
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:14,096
The funeral was not held
in that home, though.

430
00:26:14,097 --> 00:26:18,733
They went back to the homestead out
south of town and had her funeral there.

431
00:26:18,734 --> 00:26:20,768
So, Roland, what happened with the dad?

432
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:25,173
His name was John Wallace Smith, and he
lived in the house for a few more years,

433
00:26:25,174 --> 00:26:29,965
and then he passed away, and I found
his obituary in the local paper, also.

434
00:26:29,966 --> 00:26:31,235
And what'd he die of?

435
00:26:31,236 --> 00:26:33,575
Natural causes from
a cerebral hemorrhage.

436
00:26:33,576 --> 00:26:36,385
So, Sadie dies, the mother
dies about five years later,

437
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:40,088
and then the father dies a few years
after that, and they all died in the home?

438
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:42,909
In the home, yes.

439
00:26:46,577 --> 00:26:50,453
So, I'm thinking the elderly man...

440
00:26:50,454 --> 00:26:53,944
Is mad that someone is in...

441
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,106
His space.

442
00:26:56,107 --> 00:27:00,787
I think he spent a
lot of time down here.

443
00:27:01,112 --> 00:27:03,401
I'm following this angry
man around the basement

444
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:07,582
as he vents to me about how much
he hates the people living here.

445
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:12,287
Something tragic happened to him, and now
I'm experiencing all the pain he endured.

446
00:27:12,288 --> 00:27:17,568
Oh [Bleep] I'm getting a
really sharp [Bleep] pain.

447
00:27:17,593 --> 00:27:21,373
Ooh, what the [Bleep] was that?

448
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:24,686
Then that pain, the head...

449
00:27:24,687 --> 00:27:28,107
That could be an aneurysm.

450
00:27:55,531 --> 00:27:58,327
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

451
00:27:58,328 --> 00:28:03,769
we're ready to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

452
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,968
Amy, I want you to meet Amanda and Mike.

453
00:28:05,969 --> 00:28:10,865
Amanda called us in because she's had some
serious health issues since she moved in.

454
00:28:10,866 --> 00:28:15,134
She's even had a heart attack,
and she's only 32 years old.

455
00:28:15,135 --> 00:28:19,874
Doctors have no explanation for it, but
Amanda thinks she knows what's going on.

456
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:22,791
She actually thinks that
this house is killing her.

457
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:24,932
With that, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy,

458
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:29,733
and she can start
telling us about her walk.

459
00:28:31,424 --> 00:28:34,325
So, I came into this room here,

460
00:28:34,326 --> 00:28:38,196
and I saw a funeral taking place,

461
00:28:38,197 --> 00:28:40,240
for a young female.

462
00:28:40,241 --> 00:28:44,211
There was a casket, it was open, and
people were saying their goodbyes.

463
00:28:44,212 --> 00:28:46,123
Well, there was a funeral in this home.

464
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:50,027
Back in 1914, a girl, Sadie
Smith, moved here to this house.

465
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:55,928
But four years after she moved in here,
in 1918, Sadie dies of the Spanish flu.

466
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:59,727
The flu weakened her heart
until it just gave out.

467
00:28:59,728 --> 00:29:02,572
I have her death certificate here.

468
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:05,876
They have here listed, heart failure.

469
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,737
Wow.

470
00:29:10,938 --> 00:29:14,962
Oh, my God. Is that her
birth date or her death date?

471
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:16,186
Birth.

472
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:19,847
It's three days off of mine.

473
00:29:20,614 --> 00:29:23,014
Oh, my God.

474
00:29:24,423 --> 00:29:27,303
That's just crazy.

475
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,832
What else did you see?

476
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:34,881
I went to the basement,
and there's this...

477
00:29:34,882 --> 00:29:38,112
Very angry little old man down there.

478
00:29:38,113 --> 00:29:40,244
He believes that that's his space,

479
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:45,451
and he despises whoever is
residing there right now.

480
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:48,905
In fact, he's trying
to scare the person.

481
00:29:48,906 --> 00:29:52,562
Um, so that the person will leave.

482
00:29:52,563 --> 00:29:56,760
When I was talking to this guy, I
got this really sharp pain in my head.

483
00:29:56,761 --> 00:30:00,903
And I felt like he had
passed from an aneurysm.

484
00:30:00,904 --> 00:30:06,804
Now, Sadie's parents lived here, and
they actually both died in the house.

485
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:12,203
The father, John, died at the
age of 73 of cerebral hemorrhage.

486
00:30:12,204 --> 00:30:14,724
Wow. Oh, wow.

487
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,910
The tenant downstairs...

488
00:30:16,911 --> 00:30:19,402
He claims he's seen
some things down there.

489
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:22,352
- Like what?
- Shadows, five to six times.

490
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:27,023
He's told me one time that he actually
sees a man standing in the doorway here.

491
00:30:27,024 --> 00:30:28,031
Okay.

492
00:30:28,032 --> 00:30:31,754
You know what? Tell Amy about
the apparition that you saw.

493
00:30:31,755 --> 00:30:33,596
I was in the laundry room,

494
00:30:33,597 --> 00:30:38,028
and I was just grabbing something out
of the cabinet, and I turned around,

495
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:41,737
and there was a man
standing right next to me.

496
00:30:41,738 --> 00:30:44,576
I jumped and screamed,
and then he disappeared.

497
00:30:44,577 --> 00:30:48,511
- What was he wearing?
- A button-down shirt, and...

498
00:30:48,512 --> 00:30:50,921
- He had a five o'clock shadow.
- Okay.

499
00:30:50,922 --> 00:30:52,637
And dark hair.

500
00:30:52,638 --> 00:30:57,524
I briefly encountered another
male back in that area.

501
00:30:57,525 --> 00:30:59,159
Oh, my God.

502
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,996
And I did do a sketch of the man.

503
00:31:02,997 --> 00:31:05,867
He's in his early 70s...

504
00:31:05,868 --> 00:31:08,808
He does have jowls.

505
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:13,217
And his eyes are very almond-shaped.

506
00:31:16,311 --> 00:31:20,165
Well, you tell me.
You would know better.

507
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:22,566
Oh, my God.

508
00:31:25,266 --> 00:31:28,626
It looks a lot like him.

509
00:31:29,156 --> 00:31:31,012
I'll never forget him.

510
00:31:31,013 --> 00:31:34,553
He was looking right at me.

511
00:31:35,121 --> 00:31:38,922
He was just confused, so
he just gets frustrated.

512
00:31:38,923 --> 00:31:41,213
- Do you ever hear banging or anything?
- All the time.

513
00:31:41,214 --> 00:31:44,454
- All the time.
- Okay.

514
00:31:45,124 --> 00:31:47,608
So, what else did you see?

515
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:50,780
In my opening, what
I saw was actually...

516
00:31:50,781 --> 00:31:54,921
This house surrounded by thick trees.

517
00:31:55,154 --> 00:31:58,785
I was shocked, because, obviously,
there's no trees. It's all houses.

518
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:01,801
And then when I went in the
backyard, I heard an old lady.

519
00:32:01,802 --> 00:32:05,896
She was agitated that the
trees had been removed.

520
00:32:05,897 --> 00:32:10,397
Well, it makes sense you said that, because
this was owned by a guy named Isaac Swain.

521
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:13,665
Back in the 1800s, he
purchased the property here.

522
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:16,606
This was all woods.

523
00:32:17,972 --> 00:32:23,076
He came here, he bought the
property, and he opened up a mill.

524
00:32:23,077 --> 00:32:27,648
He made a lot of money, but he also
had a lot of tragedy with his family.

525
00:32:27,649 --> 00:32:29,182
Oh.

526
00:32:29,183 --> 00:32:31,043
Wow.

527
00:32:31,427 --> 00:32:34,288
I saw this little girl.

528
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:37,556
- She's the most important person here.
- Mm-hmm.

529
00:32:37,557 --> 00:32:41,306
She kind of controls or
runs most of the house.

530
00:32:41,307 --> 00:32:45,832
She's between 10 and 12, and she's
been here for a very long time...

531
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:48,064
At least over 100 years.

532
00:32:48,065 --> 00:32:49,952
But she's in a lot pain.

533
00:32:49,953 --> 00:32:53,940
Because she was in some
kind of weird accident.

534
00:32:53,941 --> 00:32:58,201
And, mentally, she's not who she was.

535
00:32:58,493 --> 00:33:01,644
She wasn't allowed to play.
She wasn't allowed to do things.

536
00:33:01,645 --> 00:33:04,828
She wasn't really allowed
to interact with people.

537
00:33:04,829 --> 00:33:07,824
Well, I didn't have to
think much about this one.

538
00:33:07,825 --> 00:33:10,719
Isaac Swain had a daughter, Louisa.

539
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,386
Between the ages of 10 and 14,
she actually hit her head...

540
00:33:15,387 --> 00:33:17,159
- And soon after that...
- Oh, man.

541
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,034
- She became mentally incapacitated.
- Oh.

542
00:33:21,035 --> 00:33:25,952
She basically couldn't care for herself.
She had to have care all the time.

543
00:33:25,953 --> 00:33:30,587
The thing is, she had two
siblings, both of which passed away.

544
00:33:30,588 --> 00:33:32,312
Whoa. What?

545
00:33:32,313 --> 00:33:35,481
One was Martha. She
died at the age of 15.

546
00:33:35,482 --> 00:33:39,152
And she had a younger brother,
William, who died at 3 in 1849.

547
00:33:39,153 --> 00:33:40,588
Wow.

548
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:43,729
Things got worse for
her, because her mom...

549
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,473
This is Vallonia...
she got sick, very sick.

550
00:33:47,474 --> 00:33:51,431
Her husband took her on a 3-year
journey all around the northeast,

551
00:33:51,432 --> 00:33:56,603
the East Coast, looking for help,
searching for a cure for her.

552
00:33:56,604 --> 00:34:01,610
This kid was left alone
at the house with nurses.

553
00:34:01,611 --> 00:34:03,546
You know, she lived
the rest of her life...

554
00:34:03,547 --> 00:34:05,553
As an invalid.

555
00:34:05,554 --> 00:34:10,650
What I got was that she does affect
everyone in the house to some extent.

556
00:34:10,651 --> 00:34:13,646
She can make people overeat...

557
00:34:13,647 --> 00:34:18,627
She can drain energy,
make people feel agitated.

558
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:20,510
- Oh, my God.
- She affects sleep...

559
00:34:20,511 --> 00:34:25,198
Can make people have terrible
dreams, or sleepwalk, which is big.

560
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,168
She climbs into bed with them,

561
00:34:27,169 --> 00:34:30,504
and she can jump inside
that person and control them.

562
00:34:30,505 --> 00:34:33,496
- Oh, my God.
- She affects everyone, but she...

563
00:34:33,497 --> 00:34:39,397
Has her sights set on one person
in this house in particular.

564
00:34:39,616 --> 00:34:43,528
She stays by this person all the time.

565
00:34:43,529 --> 00:34:45,389
Wow.

566
00:34:46,034 --> 00:34:48,727
Yeah, it's definitely me.

567
00:34:48,728 --> 00:34:52,378
One time, I got up to
go to the bathroom...

568
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:55,124
And the next thing I knew,

569
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:58,679
I was spinning a knife on the counter.

570
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,635
I didn't know I was doing
it. It was, like, not me.

571
00:35:01,636 --> 00:35:07,001
All I could think was, I
should just get it over with.

572
00:35:07,002 --> 00:35:12,522
I'm gonna die anyway. I
should just get it over with.

573
00:35:13,271 --> 00:35:15,415
- And you mentioned agitated?
- Mm-hmm.

574
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:17,409
Well, Mike's having issues.

575
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,694
Yeah. I get mad at the littlest things.

576
00:35:20,695 --> 00:35:26,460
I've been mad at her for no reason, and
then I'll go outside, and my rage is gone.

577
00:35:26,461 --> 00:35:30,078
She's trying to control you both.

578
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,479
Oh, my God.

579
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:35,953
Now, she's been scratched.

580
00:35:38,115 --> 00:35:39,975
Wow.

581
00:35:41,483 --> 00:35:45,011
That's her neck. That's
one of the scratch marks.

582
00:35:45,012 --> 00:35:47,914
And she's had them on her
stomach, on the side there.

583
00:35:47,915 --> 00:35:50,851
- Okay.
- And this is a burn mark, she thinks.

584
00:35:50,852 --> 00:35:52,819
Can that be from the little girl?

585
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:57,999
Yeah. Well, she's always holding
on, touching you constantly.

586
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,541
Is that who was crawling
in the bed with him?

587
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:03,656
Oh, she likes to do that.

588
00:36:03,657 --> 00:36:09,503
So, I did a sketch of this little girl
and the person that she's focused on.

589
00:36:09,504 --> 00:36:11,424
Okay.

590
00:36:17,748 --> 00:36:20,268
Jesus [Bleep].

591
00:36:25,401 --> 00:36:27,261
Wow.

592
00:36:27,733 --> 00:36:30,133
Oh, my God.

593
00:36:30,276 --> 00:36:33,576
So, she's always by me?

594
00:36:35,104 --> 00:36:37,384
Holy crap.

595
00:36:54,946 --> 00:37:00,418
I did a sketch of this little girl
and the person that she's focused on.

596
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:02,339
Okay.

597
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:11,347
Jesus [Bleep].

598
00:37:16,628 --> 00:37:18,488
Wow.

599
00:37:18,907 --> 00:37:21,307
Oh, my God.

600
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,820
So, she's always by me?

601
00:37:26,308 --> 00:37:28,588
Holy crap.

602
00:37:41,562 --> 00:37:44,452
She's extremely powerful.

603
00:37:44,453 --> 00:37:47,794
At one point, she charged me and took...

604
00:37:47,795 --> 00:37:51,995
All of my energy, like, in a second.

605
00:37:52,552 --> 00:37:58,452
Then I saw a very disturbing scene in
the upstairs bedroom with the two beds.

606
00:37:58,701 --> 00:38:02,421
You could feel this jealousy...

607
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:06,337
That she had for the
people in that room.

608
00:38:06,338 --> 00:38:11,138
And her intention was
to murder those people.

609
00:38:12,675 --> 00:38:17,175
And those thoughts
were being put into...

610
00:38:17,606 --> 00:38:19,274
The person's mind.

611
00:38:19,275 --> 00:38:21,391
What person are you talking about?

612
00:38:21,392 --> 00:38:24,392
Well, basically, you.

613
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:30,241
You would be her vessel to do the deed.

614
00:38:30,278 --> 00:38:36,178
She wants to get to the point where she can
control you 100% so that you'll do this.

615
00:38:36,194 --> 00:38:37,823
You okay?

616
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,624
No.

617
00:38:39,899 --> 00:38:42,239
Not really.

618
00:38:42,843 --> 00:38:48,123
Well, that room upstairs
is where Mike's kids stay.

619
00:38:59,819 --> 00:39:03,974
I thought something was
attached to me. I did.

620
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:09,256
We've had some conversations where
she's thought that my son hated her.

621
00:39:09,257 --> 00:39:11,892
And she seemed a little jealous...

622
00:39:11,893 --> 00:39:14,443
- Hmm...
- Of the kids being here.

623
00:39:14,444 --> 00:39:16,071
Makes a lot of sense.

624
00:39:16,072 --> 00:39:18,638
Now, do you remember
feeling this jealousy?

625
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:22,456
Oh, yeah. When they're here,
all his time goes to them.

626
00:39:22,457 --> 00:39:25,711
When they're here, I split my time as
best I can between all three of them.

627
00:39:25,712 --> 00:39:27,854
- Mm-hmm.
- But she never sees it that way.

628
00:39:27,855 --> 00:39:32,895
- Now, is that the girl doing it to her?
- Yes.

629
00:39:34,407 --> 00:39:39,056
Obviously, this is a lot
to absorb in one night.

630
00:39:39,057 --> 00:39:42,140
The big question... is it
safe for you guys to live here?

631
00:39:42,141 --> 00:39:44,445
Is it safe for the kids to come here?

632
00:39:44,446 --> 00:39:46,447
And will you be able to get better?

633
00:39:46,448 --> 00:39:51,907
I can't answer that, but I'll turn it over
to Amy, my partner, and see if she can.

634
00:39:51,908 --> 00:39:57,808
There's obviously some things that need
to be done to protect everybody involved.

635
00:39:58,127 --> 00:40:04,027
Some of these things initially might
sound a little bit unusual and extreme.

636
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,820
Okay.

637
00:40:06,915 --> 00:40:12,154
One of the things that I would suggest at
this point is to go through your bedroom

638
00:40:12,155 --> 00:40:16,355
and make it like a child-proof room.

639
00:40:16,987 --> 00:40:22,887
And Mike needs to sleep right outside
your room, and this is just to protect you.

640
00:40:23,467 --> 00:40:28,656
So, why is it so important that
he not sleep in there with me?

641
00:40:28,657 --> 00:40:33,962
Well, I don't want anybody in
this situation to be harmed.

642
00:40:33,963 --> 00:40:38,403
And at this point, she could harm you...

643
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:43,235
Or she could harm somebody else.

644
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:50,976
The next thing that needs to be done
is that there has to be an exorcism.

645
00:40:53,432 --> 00:40:54,196
Really?

646
00:40:54,197 --> 00:40:56,484
That's the only way you're
gonna get rid of her.

647
00:40:56,485 --> 00:40:58,705
Oh, geez.

648
00:41:00,856 --> 00:41:04,114
- That was our nightmare scenario.
- Mm-hmm.

649
00:41:04,115 --> 00:41:07,799
Now, why an exorcism instead
of trying to move somebody on?

650
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,764
She's just beyond repair.

651
00:41:09,765 --> 00:41:12,672
She's done many, many, many bad things.

652
00:41:12,673 --> 00:41:14,085
She needs to be straightened out.

653
00:41:14,086 --> 00:41:19,666
Right. I would just go to
the church and ask for help.

654
00:41:23,507 --> 00:41:28,538
Look me in the eye and tell
me you're gonna do this.

655
00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:30,737
I'm gonna do it.

656
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:34,583
My own life has already
been taken from me.

657
00:41:34,584 --> 00:41:39,313
And I don't want any more harm
to come to me or anyone else.

658
00:41:39,314 --> 00:41:41,133
Mm-hmm.

659
00:41:41,134 --> 00:41:44,014
Thank you so much.

660
00:41:46,501 --> 00:41:48,938
I really hope Amanda
and Mike follow my advice

661
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:53,041
and rid their home of the little
girl that's tormenting them.

662
00:41:53,042 --> 00:41:54,788
Once she's gone,

663
00:41:54,789 --> 00:41:57,980
I believe all the negativity
surrounding this family should vanish.

664
00:41:57,981 --> 00:42:00,657
And they can live a peaceful life.
