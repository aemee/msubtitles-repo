Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,828
There's a lot of
frickin' dead people here.

3
00:00:08,829 --> 00:00:10,930
We just get that creepy feeling.

4
00:00:10,931 --> 00:00:12,367
You feel it.

5
00:00:12,368 --> 00:00:14,503
He was evil.

6
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:17,873
He's missing his whole face.

7
00:00:17,874 --> 00:00:19,393
He was found guilty.

8
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,370
- They lost everything?
- They lost everything.

9
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:23,906
There's a hole in my head.

10
00:00:23,907 --> 00:00:26,175
I want the answers.

11
00:00:26,176 --> 00:00:27,009
This is not good.

12
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,840
Could this be dangerous?

13
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:34,641
There is an unhealthy
attachment to the dead.

14
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:38,318
They're being watched.

15
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:41,439
My name is Amy Allan.

16
00:00:41,514 --> 00:00:44,093
This thing likes death.

17
00:00:44,094 --> 00:00:45,128
I see dead people.

18
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:46,763
This thing's, like, a monster.

19
00:00:46,764 --> 00:00:48,765
I speak to dead people...

20
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:50,166
And he's pissed off now.

21
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:51,868
And they speak to me...

22
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:53,669
His head was cracked.

23
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,206
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

24
00:00:57,207 --> 00:00:58,742
This guy was murdered.

25
00:00:58,743 --> 00:01:00,241
I rely on my partner...

26
00:01:00,242 --> 00:01:03,544
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective...

27
00:01:03,545 --> 00:01:06,196
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

28
00:01:06,197 --> 00:01:09,499
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

29
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,830
You saw her?

30
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:12,202
It's my job to reveal them.

31
00:01:12,203 --> 00:01:13,237
Why would you stay here?

32
00:01:13,238 --> 00:01:15,530
But Steve and I never speak...

33
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:17,641
We never communicate
during an investigation.

34
00:01:17,642 --> 00:01:19,009
Until the very end.

35
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,782
Stop it.

36
00:01:20,783 --> 00:01:22,813
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

37
00:01:22,814 --> 00:01:25,242
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

38
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:26,572
Or time to get out.

39
00:01:26,573 --> 00:01:31,313
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

40
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:50,107
Amy and I work
independently of one another.

41
00:01:50,108 --> 00:01:53,742
I interview witnesses and research
the history of the location.

42
00:01:53,743 --> 00:01:56,834
To see if there's anything
unusual about its past.

43
00:01:56,835 --> 00:02:00,917
While Amy communicates with the dead.

44
00:02:00,918 --> 00:02:03,720
I'm in Rock Island, Illinois,
a few hours West of Chicago.

45
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:06,189
I'm on my way to meet
with a woman named Melissa,

46
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,949
who says she and her 4 year old daughter

47
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,927
are being terrorized
by spirits in the house.

48
00:02:10,928 --> 00:02:16,748
She sounds pretty bad, and
I'm hoping Amy and I can help.

49
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:26,703
Before Amy arrives, I have to clear
the area of any leading information.

50
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:29,095
This house contains a
lot of family photographs.

51
00:02:29,096 --> 00:02:33,217
So it's important I remove
them, along with the kids' names.

52
00:02:33,218 --> 00:02:37,118
To avoid influencing her findings.

53
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,742
There's a lot of frickin'
dead people here...

54
00:02:58,743 --> 00:03:01,683
Very, very negative.

55
00:03:02,313 --> 00:03:06,573
There's, like, people under the trees.

56
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:14,223
There's also this other
really creepy dude.

57
00:03:14,224 --> 00:03:17,495
He wears a cloak, and...

58
00:03:17,496 --> 00:03:21,936
He's missing pretty much his whole face.

59
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:25,981
He works with these people
in the trees, though.

60
00:03:25,982 --> 00:03:29,942
They're, like, underlings for him.

61
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:35,558
He wants to get rid of living people.

62
00:03:50,672 --> 00:03:53,737
So, Melissa, I understand that you
and your four year old daughter,

63
00:03:53,738 --> 00:03:55,210
are having problems in the house.

64
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:57,690
- Yes.
- Okay. Who else lives here?

65
00:03:57,691 --> 00:04:01,006
My husband, Mike, and our
7 year old son, Nathan.

66
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,217
And how long you living here?

67
00:04:02,218 --> 00:04:04,382
We've lived here about five years.

68
00:04:04,383 --> 00:04:06,648
So, what kind of things
are you experiencing?

69
00:04:06,649 --> 00:04:10,358
We're seeing apparitions, shadows.

70
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:14,296
Our daughter, Madison... we
want her to not be afraid.

71
00:04:14,297 --> 00:04:16,314
We want her to have a normal childhood.

72
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:17,686
What's going on with her?

73
00:04:17,687 --> 00:04:19,926
She would wake up in the
middle of the night screaming,

74
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:23,262
that a little girl was in her bed.

75
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,497
What about Nathan?

76
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:28,721
He mentioned that there was one time
he was coming up the basement stairs.

77
00:04:28,722 --> 00:04:31,818
And it felt like someone
grabbed the back of his shirt,

78
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:34,224
and was trying to pull
him down the stairs.

79
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:36,509
Now, when did things
kind of pick up here?

80
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:41,847
When we moved in, I was pregnant with
my son Noah and Nathan was about 2.

81
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,521
And um, I noticed...

82
00:04:44,522 --> 00:04:47,053
Um, a shadow in the basement.

83
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:49,539
Okay. You said your son
Noah. You didn't mention Noah.

84
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:55,180
Yeah, I was pregnant with
Noah when we bought the house.

85
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:59,398
He passed pretty much right
away after he was born.

86
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,999
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

87
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:14,313
There's two people here who are mediums.

88
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,849
One of them is extremely developed.

89
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,910
It might be a child.

90
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:29,395
This living person is
very attracted to death.

91
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:32,298
They want it around.

92
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:38,199
I think there's family members that
this person's held onto or friends.

93
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:42,778
Unhealthy attachment to the dead.

94
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:56,255
This is the room that I and my
son feel most uncomfortable in.

95
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,757
We just get that creepy feeling.

96
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,925
I feel like I'm being watched down here.

97
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:04,723
And we've heard footsteps above us.

98
00:06:04,724 --> 00:06:06,318
Has anybody else heard it besides you?

99
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,303
Yes. When we've had friends
over, they have heard it.

100
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:16,519
I don't like it, and it's like when I
go up the stairs to go back upstairs...

101
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,961
It's almost like if you were
being chased up the stairs,

102
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,647
how you want to hurry
up and get to the top.

103
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:24,588
That's how I feel.

104
00:06:27,732 --> 00:06:33,325
The people from the trees, they
do have to [Bleep] with people.

105
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:37,396
Because they do have
to follow the orders.

106
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,660
The cloaked man who's in
control of the dead from outside

107
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:43,702
sends them into the basement
to torment the living.

108
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:47,039
I think it's his mission to
have this house destroyed.

109
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,760
Some of them don't have legs.

110
00:06:52,656 --> 00:06:58,176
I saw one, like, pulling,
pulling on the person's leg.

111
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,987
I know that the living person's scared.

112
00:07:04,988 --> 00:07:10,148
They should be, because
these things are not good.

113
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:23,775
This is where most of her experiences,
if not all of them, happen.

114
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:28,080
She would wake up almost nightly
between 3:00 and 3:30 A.M.

115
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:31,383
And she would be screaming and crying,
there's a little girl in my bed!

116
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,086
Okay. Now, does she say
the girl is threatening her?

117
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,994
She says she wants to play with her.

118
00:07:35,995 --> 00:07:40,069
She says, the little girl wants to play,
and I don't want to play with her, mom.

119
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,268
She wakes up in the middle
of the night, crying um...

120
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:47,927
Just blood-curdling scream
that there are guys in her ears.

121
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:53,828
And she'll say that sometimes it
sounds like a whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.

122
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,056
I don't like being in here by myself.

123
00:07:57,057 --> 00:08:00,755
So I don't really blame her
for not wanting to be in here.

124
00:08:00,756 --> 00:08:03,756
By herself at night.

125
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:10,155
Mm-mm. No, no, no.

126
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,156
They just come in...

127
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:18,029
Solid-ass dead people. Like,
they present themselves.

128
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,990
It's a thing they do to mediums.

129
00:08:28,243 --> 00:08:33,343
If they're doing that,
then the kid is advanced.

130
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,912
So, what's going on in here?

131
00:08:41,913 --> 00:08:45,924
This is actually where Madison
was sleeping with me one night.

132
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:50,362
She wasn't feeling well, and she was
talking about the man under the bed.

133
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,563
Which bed... this one?

134
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:54,950
This bed, and, actually,
there is no under the bed.

135
00:08:54,951 --> 00:09:00,171
- What do you mean?
- The mattress sits pretty low.

136
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:01,903
You got about this
much room under there.

137
00:09:01,904 --> 00:09:05,525
Right. And so, I decided to give
her a piece of paper and a crayon,

138
00:09:05,526 --> 00:09:08,059
and I asked her to draw me the picture.

139
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:13,262
And she drew a circle with a frowny
face and red circles all over its face.

140
00:09:13,263 --> 00:09:16,794
- Do you have that picture?
- I don't still have that picture.

141
00:09:16,795 --> 00:09:18,397
Anything else in this room?

142
00:09:18,398 --> 00:09:23,222
This is also where I experienced what
felt like someone sit on the bed...

143
00:09:23,223 --> 00:09:25,511
And I actually felt the bed...

144
00:09:25,512 --> 00:09:28,628
Like this, like someone sitting there...

145
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:29,482
Okay.

146
00:09:29,483 --> 00:09:31,863
And I looked and there was
nobody there, and I'm like,

147
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:36,021
well, maybe I just felt something,
and then I felt the bed lift.

148
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:38,905
- When this happened, were you sleeping?
- No, I was not asleep yet.

149
00:09:38,906 --> 00:09:43,526
I was laying there,
trying to fall asleep.

150
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:50,546
The dead in here...

151
00:09:50,547 --> 00:09:53,487
Are from out there.

152
00:09:55,388 --> 00:10:01,088
They are the people from the
trees, and so many come in.

153
00:10:04,295 --> 00:10:07,059
What are they trying to do?

154
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,340
Hurt them.

155
00:10:33,321 --> 00:10:35,381
Mike, I spoke with your wife, Melissa.

156
00:10:35,382 --> 00:10:38,617
It seemed obvious that your
daughter was her biggest concern.

157
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:41,466
That's the biggest concern
for me is my daughter...

158
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:44,123
And Melissa has always told me
things that have happened to her,

159
00:10:44,124 --> 00:10:47,717
and I haven't seen it myself, so for
me, it was hard for me to believe...

160
00:10:47,718 --> 00:10:48,523
Right.

161
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:51,763
But now that the daughter's in the
picture, telling me kind of the same stuff,

162
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:55,013
I tend to believe Madison
because she's so small.

163
00:10:55,014 --> 00:10:56,335
Have you had any experiences?

164
00:10:56,336 --> 00:10:59,571
- I've had one here in Madison's room.
- Explain that one to me.

165
00:10:59,572 --> 00:11:02,787
It was actually this
shopping cart right here.

166
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:06,337
And the shopping cart was actually in
the middle of the room, like this...

167
00:11:06,338 --> 00:11:07,152
Okay.

168
00:11:07,153 --> 00:11:11,878
Loaded up with toys, and Madison woke up
screaming and pointed at the shopping cart.

169
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,293
Did you ask her what
she was screaming about?

170
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:16,905
I just assumed that she wanted
it back by her bed again,

171
00:11:16,906 --> 00:11:21,060
so at that point I just said, all
right. Put it right here next to you.

172
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:24,629
Must've been probably a half-hour
later... I was back in bed again myself.

173
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,532
She woke up screaming, shrieks.

174
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:27,632
Okay.

175
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:30,006
And then I came back in here,
and this rug was in the middle

176
00:11:30,007 --> 00:11:33,472
of the floor and the cart was
turned and pushed to about here.

177
00:11:33,473 --> 00:11:36,448
- What happened? Did she push it?
- Well, that was my first thought.

178
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:38,190
I'm like, you know,
she just pushed it away,

179
00:11:38,191 --> 00:11:41,110
but then if she just pushed it away,
why would she be screaming about it?

180
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:42,915
She didn't tell me that
anybody had pushed it.

181
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,300
She didn't tell me that
anybody took it away from her.

182
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:48,853
She was just screaming,
pointing at that cart that moved.

183
00:11:48,854 --> 00:11:51,871
Now, Mike, after this incident
happened, the stuff you can't explain,

184
00:11:51,872 --> 00:11:54,618
are you a skeptic, not a
skeptic? What's your story?

185
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:56,675
It opened my eyes is what it did.

186
00:11:56,676 --> 00:11:58,596
Okay.

187
00:12:01,434 --> 00:12:04,554
There's a disturbance.

188
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:08,551
I hear things moving...

189
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:11,943
Like, chairs moving...

190
00:12:11,944 --> 00:12:16,384
Mm, maybe a little bit of a poltergeist.

191
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,577
Yeah, and stuff happens in here...

192
00:12:21,578 --> 00:12:23,467
Poltergeist [Bleep] you know?

193
00:12:23,468 --> 00:12:26,011
Poltergeists are usually
created unintentionally,

194
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:29,640
when someone with abilities
represses intense negative emotions.

195
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:32,843
These powerful forces can
interact with the physical world,

196
00:12:32,844 --> 00:12:35,512
and in some cases, harm living people.

197
00:12:35,513 --> 00:12:37,548
Do you have any idea
who it's coming from?

198
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:40,217
- I want to say a female.
- Okay.

199
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:44,373
The living person doesn't know how to
release their [Bleep] emotions properly.

200
00:12:44,374 --> 00:12:46,276
Anything that could be dangerous?

201
00:12:46,277 --> 00:12:48,137
Yes.

202
00:12:50,772 --> 00:12:53,496
Mike, I know you're probably
at your wits' end with this,

203
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:56,414
but what are you hoping we can help
you out with this investigation?

204
00:12:56,415 --> 00:12:59,726
I just want my kids to feel comfortable
and safe everywhere in our house.

205
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:02,997
Nathan is not really comfortable
going in the basement by himself.

206
00:13:02,998 --> 00:13:05,800
Melissa is not real comfortable
with the attic at all.

207
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:07,268
- The attic?
- Right.

208
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:10,245
- She didn't mention the attic.
- There's an attic out here in the hallway.

209
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:13,726
- Can you show me?
- Yeah.

210
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:24,610
What's the story? Why does
Melissa not like going up here?

211
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:27,847
Just kind of a dark, creepy thing.
She's just not real comfortable.

212
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,782
I don't think she's
ever been up here once.

213
00:13:29,783 --> 00:13:31,850
Right, and do you know
much about the house?

214
00:13:31,851 --> 00:13:33,486
I know it was built back in the '40s.

215
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:36,555
Before there was a house on the
land, it was owned by John Looney,

216
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:40,756
and he was a gangster back in
the '20s to '40s in Rock Island.

217
00:13:40,757 --> 00:13:43,095
Okay. Let me ask you a
question, though, Mike.

218
00:13:43,096 --> 00:13:47,367
If at the end of our investigation Amy
turns around and says, you know what?

219
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,824
You can't fix this. You got to get
out of this house, what would you do?

220
00:13:50,825 --> 00:13:52,221
That would be hard for me.

221
00:13:52,222 --> 00:13:55,002
You know, as the husband
and the father of the house,

222
00:13:55,003 --> 00:13:57,806
I want to be able to find the answers,

223
00:13:57,807 --> 00:14:00,538
to stop my daughter from screaming
in the middle of the night.

224
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,855
So I'm hoping having you guys out here,
we'll be able to find some sort of answer.

225
00:14:03,856 --> 00:14:05,776
Okay.

226
00:14:13,427 --> 00:14:18,163
A lot of the people that
are in the kids' area...

227
00:14:18,164 --> 00:14:22,458
They kind of live up
here or hang out up here.

228
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:25,425
But they all kind of work together.

229
00:14:25,426 --> 00:14:29,986
And they died in
various ways and places.

230
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,639
[Bleep] This is not good.

231
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,890
So, Nathan, I was talking
to mom and dad before.

232
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:48,733
They told me that you've been
experiencing some stuff in the house here?

233
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:50,830
- Uh-huh.
- Explain that to me.

234
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:53,165
I was in my bed, looking at the closet.

235
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:57,369
I saw, like, a gray
shadow running across it.

236
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,979
- Which closet... the one outside?
- Over there.

237
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,811
- Can you make out what it was?
- It was kind of a person shadow.

238
00:15:05,812 --> 00:15:09,125
- All right. So, did that scare you?
- It scared me a lot.

239
00:15:09,126 --> 00:15:13,340
Just tried not to think
of it and have a nightmare.

240
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:17,456
- Okay. Did you tell anybody about it?
- No, I haven't yet.

241
00:15:17,457 --> 00:15:19,658
You haven't? Okay.

242
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:21,794
So, anything else happen?

243
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,797
I felt someone trying
to pull me downstairs.

244
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,844
- Down in the basement?
- Mm-hmm.

245
00:15:26,845 --> 00:15:30,002
- How?
- Like, grabbing onto my shirt.

246
00:15:30,003 --> 00:15:32,571
I've been lied to by
seasoned sociopaths,

247
00:15:32,572 --> 00:15:35,908
and I can always see through their
lies, so when I'm talking to a kid,

248
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:38,878
I know when they're telling
me the truth, and this one is.

249
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:41,527
Are you scared to be at home?

250
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:43,388
Yes.

251
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:49,930
The ones that are coming in
here, they can get kind of nasty.

252
00:15:49,931 --> 00:15:52,945
They more look like shadows...

253
00:15:52,946 --> 00:15:56,328
But they, like, are
up against the walls.

254
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:58,998
Two groups of dead people
are roaming this structure...

255
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,469
The ones presenting themselves
to the mediums who live here.

256
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,104
And the ones crawling across the floors
of the basement and Master Bedroom.

257
00:16:06,105 --> 00:16:10,077
They have one thing in common...
they both have bad intentions.

258
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,076
Is there anything else these
people can do to the living?

259
00:16:13,077 --> 00:16:18,977
You see them out of the corner
of your eye, but you feel them.

260
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,780
What will these things eventually do?

261
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:24,781
Well, they can kill.

262
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:43,967
Mike told me that a mobster
used to own his land,

263
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:48,371
so I made some calls, and
it turns out he's right.

264
00:16:48,372 --> 00:16:52,477
Going to meet with a local author who
says a guy by the name of John Looney

265
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:58,378
used to run a bloody empire right
off of Mike and Melissa's property.

266
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:07,057
So, you wrote this book about
Looney, and from what I understand,

267
00:17:07,058 --> 00:17:10,459
he actually owned the property
that I'm investigating.

268
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,097
- Is that correct?
- That's correct.

269
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:15,709
This is John Looney about the
time he came to Rock Island.

270
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,235
In the late 1800s...

271
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:21,198
He met a woman named Nora O'Connor.

272
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,017
They got married, and they
had two daughters and a son.

273
00:17:25,018 --> 00:17:26,219
Okay.

274
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,316
But about 1903, his wife dies.

275
00:17:29,317 --> 00:17:31,791
And after she left...

276
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:35,228
He spiraled downward
into this life of crime.

277
00:17:35,229 --> 00:17:38,421
He was involved in gambling, moonshine.

278
00:17:38,422 --> 00:17:41,015
He was involved in prostitution.

279
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:45,386
This is Looney from sort
of the height of his power.

280
00:17:45,387 --> 00:17:47,689
How powerful did this guy get?

281
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,959
Well, he basically controlled the town.

282
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,844
People were very afraid of him.

283
00:17:52,845 --> 00:17:56,025
Basically if there was something
going on in town that was illegal,

284
00:17:56,026 --> 00:17:58,169
Looney was involved with it.

285
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,300
Okay. Now, I assume
he was a violent man.

286
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:02,485
Well, we know that a lot of people died,

287
00:18:02,486 --> 00:18:07,844
and Looney had people on his payroll who
were, you know, basically paid hit men.

288
00:18:07,845 --> 00:18:10,696
Do we know if he ever buried
any bodies on the property?

289
00:18:10,697 --> 00:18:13,598
Just the fact that he
had, you know, this large,

290
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:19,499
piece of land with nobody living
around it, the opportunity existed.

291
00:18:21,872 --> 00:18:24,923
There's, like, a family out there...

292
00:18:24,924 --> 00:18:30,824
You know, like, a mother, a father,
I think like two or three kids.

293
00:18:34,885 --> 00:18:39,505
But their father...
he's kind of freaky...

294
00:18:39,523 --> 00:18:42,382
Kind of creepy-looking, too...

295
00:18:42,383 --> 00:18:45,443
Dressed all in black.

296
00:18:47,364 --> 00:18:51,984
I'm getting something
about dirty dealings.

297
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:54,081
What does he do?

298
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:57,562
He's, like, burying bodies.

299
00:19:01,212 --> 00:19:05,048
So, it was about 1922 and Looney's
empire started to fall apart.

300
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:06,382
In what way?

301
00:19:06,383 --> 00:19:09,853
There had been a big split
in Looney's organization.

302
00:19:09,854 --> 00:19:12,511
Some of his former lieutenants
who'd formed their own gang

303
00:19:12,512 --> 00:19:14,891
basically set up a hit on Looney.

304
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:17,435
They didn't get him,
but they got his son.

305
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:19,372
Was he there when the son got shot?

306
00:19:19,373 --> 00:19:21,287
- Yes.
- He was?

307
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:23,369
Basically they pulled up
in front of this hotel.

308
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:27,203
Looney was going in to get some
papers, and these other guys pull up...

309
00:19:27,204 --> 00:19:31,074
Or they jump out and open fire,
and Looney runs for the hotel,

310
00:19:31,075 --> 00:19:33,409
goes up on the second floor,
and starts firing back,

311
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:37,408
but the son gets shot down on the
sidewalk before he ever got to the door.

312
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:41,969
And eventually dies
later at the hospital.

313
00:19:50,294 --> 00:19:54,063
Uh-oh. I just got a nasty headache.

314
00:19:54,064 --> 00:19:58,324
And someone's yelling about a gunshot.

315
00:19:59,347 --> 00:20:02,638
I do feel like there's
a hole in my head.

316
00:20:07,577 --> 00:20:11,247
There's, like, blood and then confusion.

317
00:20:11,248 --> 00:20:15,268
Like, I don't know if they lived.

318
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:19,773
After his son was murdered,
things just sort of fell apart.

319
00:20:19,774 --> 00:20:22,865
The city leaders started to shut
down the gambling parlors and the

320
00:20:22,866 --> 00:20:26,312
hotels and the houses of prostitution
and started arresting people.

321
00:20:26,313 --> 00:20:29,032
And when the whole
house of cards fell in,

322
00:20:29,033 --> 00:20:32,105
the Feds went after
him and he was arrested.

323
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:35,738
And then subsequently, they
filed murder charges against him

324
00:20:35,739 --> 00:20:38,874
for the murder of a local
bar owner named Bill Gabel,

325
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:43,255
who refused to pay him protection money.

326
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:46,144
He was eventually found guilty.

327
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:49,919
He ended up sentenced to 14 years
for the murder and served 8 of it.

328
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,066
Where did he wind up when
he came out of prison?

329
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:54,414
Well, his daughter picks him
up at the prison gate and,

330
00:20:54,415 --> 00:20:57,097
he goes to live with her
and her husband in Texas.

331
00:20:57,098 --> 00:21:02,631
And he's there about eight years, and then
he ends up dying from a lung condition.

332
00:21:02,632 --> 00:21:04,570
And how old was he when he died?

333
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:07,511
He was 75 in 1942.

334
00:21:08,064 --> 00:21:09,984
Okay.

335
00:21:17,022 --> 00:21:19,191
This guy dressed all in black...

336
00:21:19,192 --> 00:21:23,512
He's probably, like, in his early 70s.

337
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,266
He's fairly recent... he's
fairly recently dead or something.

338
00:21:27,267 --> 00:21:30,201
But I keep seeing these
bodies all over the place.

339
00:21:30,202 --> 00:21:36,102
He's, like, digging them and just
throwing them in the ground, you know?

340
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:40,033
Nobody likes him.

341
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:42,494
He was evil.

342
00:21:43,492 --> 00:21:48,352
He definitely was not
involved in good things.

343
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,681
I'm at the library to see
if anyone else of interest

344
00:22:04,682 --> 00:22:08,017
owned my clients' property
before John Looney.

345
00:22:08,018 --> 00:22:11,280
Digging through the archives, I
discover a man named Sam Bowles,

346
00:22:11,281 --> 00:22:14,424
who lived on the property in
the 1800s with his wife, Eliza.

347
00:22:14,425 --> 00:22:18,433
But what really caught my attention is
the headline surrounding their marriage.

348
00:22:18,434 --> 00:22:22,571
Turns out Eliza went to the newspapers
to make their troubles public.

349
00:22:22,572 --> 00:22:26,232
Claiming her husband beat her.

350
00:22:27,104 --> 00:22:29,273
I'm no expert on the 19th century,

351
00:22:29,274 --> 00:22:32,176
but I don't think it was real common
for women to go to the newspaper,

352
00:22:32,177 --> 00:22:34,347
claiming their husbands abused them.

353
00:22:34,348 --> 00:22:36,506
I'm on my way to meet
with a local historian

354
00:22:36,507 --> 00:22:41,487
who promises to tell me
the rest of the story.

355
00:22:47,124 --> 00:22:50,196
I thought it strange that
in 1886, a woman would

356
00:22:50,197 --> 00:22:52,329
actually go to the paper
about domestic violence.

357
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,961
That wasn't common back then, was it?

358
00:22:53,962 --> 00:22:55,961
- No, absolutely not.
- Okay.

359
00:22:55,962 --> 00:22:57,890
Domestic violence was a
taboo subject back then.

360
00:22:57,891 --> 00:22:59,932
You typically didn't read
about it in the newspaper,

361
00:22:59,933 --> 00:23:02,124
and you wouldn't have talked
to your family about it.

362
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:05,938
Now, Bobbi, you mentioned on the phone that
there was a little bit more to the story.

363
00:23:05,939 --> 00:23:11,839
One week after that was published in
the newspaper, Eliza died of a stroke.

364
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,847
Do you know if she was sick?

365
00:23:14,848 --> 00:23:17,540
No, she wasn't. It was a sudden death.

366
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:19,771
Okay. Did they have any
children, the two of them?

367
00:23:19,772 --> 00:23:24,512
Yes, they actually had
one daughter, Telitha.

368
00:23:26,626 --> 00:23:29,088
She was born in 1861.

369
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:31,497
Okay, now, what kind of guy was Samuel?

370
00:23:31,498 --> 00:23:33,911
He was a very prominent
man in his community.

371
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:38,282
He actually had built them a school, a
church, and a cemetery for its citizens.

372
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:40,507
So, Bobbi, what ended up
happening with this guy?

373
00:23:40,508 --> 00:23:43,082
He actually died in 1893.

374
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:46,192
And Telitha inherited his estate.

375
00:23:46,193 --> 00:23:48,000
She sold it off piece by piece,

376
00:23:48,001 --> 00:23:53,461
and eventually the last
piece was sold to John Looney.

377
00:23:55,355 --> 00:23:58,415
I'm seeing a female.

378
00:24:01,027 --> 00:24:04,747
She is kind of prissy, uppity.

379
00:24:05,031 --> 00:24:09,626
She's wearing a very lacy
dress, comes all the way up.

380
00:24:09,627 --> 00:24:15,087
I think that her parents
might have died pretty young.

381
00:24:18,494 --> 00:24:23,675
And she's disgusted by the
people she's surrounded by.

382
00:24:23,676 --> 00:24:26,195
This house is crawling with dead people.

383
00:24:26,196 --> 00:24:30,833
And what has me disturbed is their
attraction to the children's rooms.

384
00:24:30,834 --> 00:24:33,626
She's just very...

385
00:24:33,627 --> 00:24:35,787
Advanced.

386
00:24:38,381 --> 00:24:41,734
During my research, I also
discovered that before Samuel Bowles,

387
00:24:41,735 --> 00:24:46,896
Native Americans lived all over
what's now my clients' property.

388
00:24:46,897 --> 00:24:49,555
In this part of the country,
that's no big surprise.

389
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:52,878
But when I called the local Curator
of the Native American museum,

390
00:24:52,879 --> 00:24:58,779
she said that what went down
there may be helpful to my case.

391
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,021
So, I understand the
property I'm investigating

392
00:25:07,022 --> 00:25:08,661
used to be Native American territory?

393
00:25:08,662 --> 00:25:11,149
- That's correct.
- Okay. What can you tell me about it?

394
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:16,019
Well, the last tribe of Indians to inhabit
that area were the Sauk Nation of Indians,

395
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:20,717
and they were here from about
1735 and was about 5,000 people.

396
00:25:20,718 --> 00:25:22,908
Okay, so, what happened
with the Indians there?

397
00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:26,879
They lost their land to the
American government in 1804,

398
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,430
but only about two-thirds of
the tribe was willing to go.

399
00:25:30,431 --> 00:25:34,653
About one-third of the tribe, that
was led by the warrior Black Hawk.

400
00:25:34,654 --> 00:25:37,456
Refused to leave the
land of their ancestors.

401
00:25:37,457 --> 00:25:42,077
Black Hawk said, I'll
die before I leave.

402
00:25:43,129 --> 00:25:47,933
But one of their spokesmen
was a man named Keokuk...

403
00:25:47,934 --> 00:25:52,254
Who was very friendly to the Americans.

404
00:25:52,331 --> 00:25:55,540
He was able to convince his own people,

405
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:58,190
that there was no point in
fighting the American government

406
00:25:58,191 --> 00:26:00,846
and it was better to just
move as they were told.

407
00:26:00,847 --> 00:26:03,851
What about the people that didn't
support him, how did they feel about him?

408
00:26:03,852 --> 00:26:06,419
Well, they felt that he was a coward...

409
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,854
A traitor to their nation.

410
00:26:08,855 --> 00:26:12,966
Black Hawk felt nothing
but disdain for him.

411
00:26:12,967 --> 00:26:17,763
So, the people that sided with Keokuk,
did they prosper with the deal he made?

412
00:26:17,764 --> 00:26:20,702
Well, no, they were
removed over into Iowa...

413
00:26:20,703 --> 00:26:23,637
And told that they
could live there forever.

414
00:26:23,638 --> 00:26:27,439
But within 10 years of
this promise, they're gone.

415
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,240
- They lost everything?
- They lost everything.

416
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:39,815
I'm seeing this leader guy
again, who's wearing a cloak.

417
00:26:39,816 --> 00:26:45,160
And he says, they're still our
territories and we still watch over them.

418
00:26:45,161 --> 00:26:48,191
But when he was alive, he screwed up.

419
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:51,493
He wasn't doing his job.

420
00:26:51,494 --> 00:26:54,111
He says that everybody who's come since

421
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:58,834
has just [Bleep] everything
up and destroyed it.

422
00:26:58,835 --> 00:27:03,094
He feels justified as far
as wreaking havoc on people.

423
00:27:03,095 --> 00:27:04,935
What does he do?

424
00:27:04,936 --> 00:27:10,836
Basically whatever needs to be done,
but he sends his people in to do it.

425
00:27:13,405 --> 00:27:14,888
What do you mean?

426
00:27:14,889 --> 00:27:19,269
The people that he puts in the trees...

427
00:27:19,692 --> 00:27:21,941
Were from his time...

428
00:27:21,942 --> 00:27:24,762
Like 17-something.

429
00:27:27,601 --> 00:27:31,673
When he sends people into the house...

430
00:27:31,674 --> 00:27:34,794
Why is he doing that?

431
00:27:36,677 --> 00:27:41,657
That's him trying to
get rid of this building.

432
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:09,873
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations.

433
00:28:09,874 --> 00:28:15,774
We're ready to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

434
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:18,435
Mike and Melissa have
been here about five years.

435
00:28:18,436 --> 00:28:21,991
Melissa's had experiences
from the minute they came here.

436
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,835
They have two beautiful children,

437
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:26,738
and one of their kids is
having a very tough time here.

438
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:30,347
Waking up in the middle of the night,
screaming, crying. She's afraid to be here.

439
00:28:30,348 --> 00:28:34,161
So they're concerned if their kids
can live here in a safe environment,

440
00:28:34,162 --> 00:28:36,810
and that's why they called us in.

441
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:39,946
With that, I'm gonna have Amy
start to talk about her walk.

442
00:28:39,947 --> 00:28:42,417
I immediately get the
sense that someone here

443
00:28:42,418 --> 00:28:45,219
is contributing to what's
happening in this house.

444
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:49,245
But I can also tell they're not
emotionally ready to hear it yet.

445
00:28:49,246 --> 00:28:52,579
One of the first people that
I encountered was a male.

446
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,119
He's not a good guy.

447
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,697
He was dressed all in black.

448
00:28:56,698 --> 00:28:59,599
I did get that while he was
alive, he was particularly evil.

449
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,770
And he definitely was not
involved in anything good.

450
00:29:03,771 --> 00:29:06,072
Who do you guys think it sounds like?

451
00:29:06,073 --> 00:29:07,996
- John Looney.
- John Looney?

452
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:13,152
John Looney was a gangster that
owned this property back in the 1920s.

453
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:17,450
He was involved in everything...
prostitution, gambling, bootlegging.

454
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:21,289
He was supposedly very ruthless...
got convicted of murder.

455
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:25,292
He was suspected in
many, many more deaths.

456
00:29:25,293 --> 00:29:28,928
There's pictures of him here.

457
00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:31,269
Interesting.

458
00:29:38,272 --> 00:29:43,169
I think his reason for buying the property
up here was because it was perfect for...

459
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:46,145
- Burying bodies... great.
- Burying bodies.

460
00:29:46,146 --> 00:29:48,674
Now, you think the guy you saw was him?

461
00:29:48,675 --> 00:29:51,735
Looks like him, yeah.

462
00:29:54,255 --> 00:29:56,221
What else did you see?

463
00:29:56,222 --> 00:30:01,528
Well, then I saw something out
back which was pretty freaky.

464
00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:04,747
Under the trees are all these people.

465
00:30:04,748 --> 00:30:09,488
And all of them used
to live on this land.

466
00:30:09,637 --> 00:30:12,710
And their leader was
this man who came up.

467
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:16,610
He walked up, and he
was wearing a dark cloak.

468
00:30:16,611 --> 00:30:22,511
And I got that this guy was from
a very long time ago, like 1700s.

469
00:30:22,757 --> 00:30:28,035
He feels that his job was to be
in charge of a large territory.

470
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:31,847
And he screwed up. He
just made a big mistake.

471
00:30:31,848 --> 00:30:34,464
And now that he's dead he,

472
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:38,626
does an incredible job of
watching his territories...

473
00:30:38,627 --> 00:30:41,447
Psychotically too well.

474
00:30:41,448 --> 00:30:42,856
It's interesting you say that.

475
00:30:42,857 --> 00:30:47,798
There was a tribe of Indians called the
Sauk Nation that inhabited your land.

476
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:50,877
There was an Indian
by the name of Keokuk.

477
00:30:50,878 --> 00:30:53,925
And when the white men came,
he kind of appeased them...

478
00:30:53,926 --> 00:30:56,528
And kind of played
both sides of the coin.

479
00:30:56,529 --> 00:31:02,429
He basically sold out the whole Indian
nation here and had them displaced.

480
00:31:02,743 --> 00:31:05,383
This is Keokuk.

481
00:31:08,262 --> 00:31:13,374
Even to this day, that tribe
feels he sold the whole tribe out.

482
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:19,275
Well, it kind of makes sense, because what
this person wants is the house to be gone.

483
00:31:21,418 --> 00:31:25,033
He said he's not the only one
who watches this territory.

484
00:31:25,034 --> 00:31:28,782
He'll send other people to,
like, take care of business.

485
00:31:28,783 --> 00:31:31,194
Now, did you see any of those
people inside this house?

486
00:31:31,195 --> 00:31:34,400
There was a lot of them
in The Master Bedroom.

487
00:31:34,401 --> 00:31:38,591
On the floor, around the bed basically.

488
00:31:38,592 --> 00:31:40,092
Some of them can't walk.

489
00:31:40,093 --> 00:31:45,264
Some of them can only crawl
or, like, pull themselves.

490
00:31:45,265 --> 00:31:47,970
Tell Amy about Madison, what she saw.

491
00:31:47,971 --> 00:31:50,014
She was sleeping with
me in bed one night.

492
00:31:50,015 --> 00:31:53,973
She said she didn't want to go to
sleep because of the man under the bed.

493
00:31:53,974 --> 00:31:56,176
And I said, well, there's
no man under the bed.

494
00:31:56,177 --> 00:31:59,740
And she goes, yes,
mommy, he's under there.

495
00:31:59,741 --> 00:32:02,267
And then she got down
and looked under the bed,

496
00:32:02,268 --> 00:32:04,364
and I said, see, there's
no one under there.

497
00:32:04,365 --> 00:32:07,851
She started pointing, and she
said, mommy, he's right there.

498
00:32:07,852 --> 00:32:11,053
That thing with the bed... you had told
me about you were laying in bed alone.

499
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,000
- Mm-hmm.
- Tell Amy about that, too.

500
00:32:13,001 --> 00:32:17,059
Yeah, I had just gotten into bed, and
I felt somebody sit down on the bed,

501
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,196
so I turned to look and
there's nothing there.

502
00:32:20,197 --> 00:32:24,042
And then I felt it... whatever
it was... get up off the bed.

503
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:26,845
Would that have been what you were
talking about in The Master Bedroom?

504
00:32:26,846 --> 00:32:29,813
- Doing that to the bed?
- Um, probably not.

505
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:32,814
That's probably him.

506
00:32:35,813 --> 00:32:39,053
I just got goose bumps.

507
00:32:40,736 --> 00:32:42,766
So, what else is going on?

508
00:32:42,767 --> 00:32:45,812
Then I went down to the basement.

509
00:32:45,813 --> 00:32:49,039
And uh, I saw some of
the specific dead people

510
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,643
that I think were sent
to destroy your house.

511
00:32:53,644 --> 00:32:58,014
They're all naked, they're all in
different levels of decomposition.

512
00:32:58,015 --> 00:33:00,349
And I think two of them want help.

513
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:04,487
I actually saw somebody
doing laundry, a female.

514
00:33:04,488 --> 00:33:09,559
This was a living person, and one
of them was crawling on the floor.

515
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,576
And was actually trying to
grab the person's pant leg.

516
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:17,774
Yeah, there's something
about that laundry room.

517
00:33:17,775 --> 00:33:21,330
I feel like I'm always being watched.

518
00:33:21,331 --> 00:33:24,734
Nathan had another incident in the
basement here, going up the stairs.

519
00:33:24,735 --> 00:33:26,309
Tell Amy about that.

520
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:30,726
He was walking up the stairs, and then he
felt a little tug on the back of his shirt.

521
00:33:30,727 --> 00:33:32,223
Okay. Interesting.

522
00:33:32,224 --> 00:33:34,985
And do you think this would be one
of these people that tugged on him?

523
00:33:34,986 --> 00:33:36,846
Yes.

524
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:39,923
Let me ask you something. You
said you saw a living woman?

525
00:33:39,924 --> 00:33:42,663
- That's what you saw?
- Mm-hmm. Well, I sketched it.

526
00:33:42,664 --> 00:33:45,148
- You sketched that scene you saw?
- Yes.

527
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:47,549
She's gray.

528
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,660
Her hair is all kind of wet.

529
00:33:52,662 --> 00:33:56,742
Her legs are kind of bent sideways.

530
00:34:03,705 --> 00:34:06,645
Wow. That's creepy.

531
00:34:09,073 --> 00:34:10,933
Wow.

532
00:34:18,796 --> 00:34:21,052
- That's pretty scary.
- It's sad.

533
00:34:21,053 --> 00:34:25,313
It's just so uneasy for me in there.

534
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:32,592
Maybe this person is
reaching out to me for help.

535
00:34:33,085 --> 00:34:35,945
Why would they be reaching
out to Melissa for help?

536
00:34:35,946 --> 00:34:39,047
I did get that there was someone
here who brings in the dead.

537
00:34:39,048 --> 00:34:42,059
There is a female who they
think is a medium here.

538
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:47,220
So, when you are a medium, dead people
are attracted to you who want help.

539
00:34:47,221 --> 00:34:51,523
And I did get that this individual doesn't
quite know what to do with this ability.

540
00:34:51,524 --> 00:34:55,353
There is a slight unhealthy
attraction to death.

541
00:34:55,354 --> 00:34:57,647
Like an obsession with it.

542
00:34:57,648 --> 00:35:01,746
It's dangerous because
there's a fine line there.

543
00:35:01,747 --> 00:35:07,267
And a lot of the dead here
can inadvertently harm you.

544
00:35:25,421 --> 00:35:31,026
I did get that there was someone
here who brings in the dead.

545
00:35:31,027 --> 00:35:36,927
There is a slight unhealthy attraction
to death, like an obsession with it.

546
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:44,050
It's dangerous, and a lot of the
dead here can inadvertently harm you.

547
00:35:46,626 --> 00:35:49,711
Well, when I first started
interviewing Melissa,

548
00:35:49,712 --> 00:35:54,067
she had told me that she's had
experiences since she was a kid.

549
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:56,954
I always felt like I had
had psychic abilities,

550
00:35:56,955 --> 00:36:01,752
but I had never really been
afraid of my experiences.

551
00:36:01,753 --> 00:36:02,785
Mm-hmm.

552
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:06,899
Now that my daughter had been
really, really frightened.

553
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,364
I was like, okay, there's
something going on,

554
00:36:09,365 --> 00:36:12,342
and we need to get this taken care of.

555
00:36:12,343 --> 00:36:14,904
Now, you believe this stuff gets
passed down through generations.

556
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:16,360
Oh, absolutely, yeah.

557
00:36:16,361 --> 00:36:21,235
And the other thing was getting that there
was a child who's extremely open here.

558
00:36:21,236 --> 00:36:26,396
And very well developed,
which is very interesting.

559
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:32,377
When I went into their bedroom,
the dead lined up and greeted me.

560
00:36:32,378 --> 00:36:34,322
It's a type of introduction.

561
00:36:34,323 --> 00:36:39,585
Usually this is, like, for, you
know, really advanced mediums.

562
00:36:39,586 --> 00:36:43,065
- So I was, like, shocked.
- And you saw this in Nathan's room?

563
00:36:43,066 --> 00:36:46,070
I don't know. It had
the bunk beds, I think.

564
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:49,611
Yeah, that's Nathan's room.

565
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:51,942
I feel like Mike and
Melissa have always known,

566
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:54,042
that something wasn't
right in their home.

567
00:36:54,043 --> 00:36:57,011
They've just been too afraid
to admit it to each other.

568
00:36:57,012 --> 00:36:59,831
I think your daughter has
something going on, too.

569
00:36:59,832 --> 00:37:05,592
But right now, he is way more
advanced than your daughter.

570
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:10,878
It makes sense, with
him not being afraid.

571
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:14,162
This is Nathan.

572
00:37:14,163 --> 00:37:16,443
Aw. Cutie!

573
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:21,705
Has anything traumatic happened to him?

574
00:37:23,573 --> 00:37:25,607
Nathan was about 2 years old.

575
00:37:25,608 --> 00:37:29,508
We had another son, named Noah...

576
00:37:29,633 --> 00:37:30,941
Okay.

577
00:37:30,942 --> 00:37:35,683
And he actually passed
away shortly after birth.

578
00:37:35,684 --> 00:37:37,738
I have Noah's picture.
Can I show that to Amy?

579
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:40,555
- Is that all right?
- Sure.

580
00:37:40,556 --> 00:37:42,268
This is right before he passed.

581
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:44,069
Aw.

582
00:37:49,265 --> 00:37:52,567
We knew something was wrong
halfway through the pregnancy.

583
00:37:52,568 --> 00:37:55,148
So, you guys were preparing
for this before, even.

584
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:57,571
I never prepared for it.

585
00:37:57,572 --> 00:38:01,952
I didn't accept that he wouldn't live.

586
00:38:08,351 --> 00:38:11,520
Now that I know about Noah,
it all makes sense to me.

587
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:17,421
So, the last thing was a little
bit of poltergeist going on here.

588
00:38:17,627 --> 00:38:19,894
I felt things were
sliding across the floor.

589
00:38:19,895 --> 00:38:24,334
I felt that the adult
medium won't let go,

590
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:26,468
specifically to the family and friends.

591
00:38:26,469 --> 00:38:30,438
And this is kind of something
that is being held inside.

592
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:34,363
And is coming out in this manner.

593
00:38:34,364 --> 00:38:37,672
And I think this person has some anger.

594
00:38:37,673 --> 00:38:41,873
And it's not being properly released.

595
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,220
That sound like you?

596
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,800
Sorry.

597
00:38:58,801 --> 00:39:01,141
It's okay.

598
00:39:03,794 --> 00:39:07,707
I've had other people tell me that...

599
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:11,968
I haven't grieved properly for Noah...

600
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,860
So that makes sense.

601
00:39:19,088 --> 00:39:22,151
I can't think of um...

602
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:26,232
Anything I've noticed, like, moving.

603
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,008
The one thing that I've found
unexplainable in this house

604
00:39:31,009 --> 00:39:33,186
since I've been living here is a,

605
00:39:33,187 --> 00:39:36,762
shopping cart that Madison has in
her room, a little toy shopping cart.

606
00:39:36,763 --> 00:39:41,513
It was parallel to her bed at one point,
full of toys, when she was younger.

607
00:39:41,514 --> 00:39:44,008
And she woke up screaming. I
came into her room, and it was

608
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:45,835
- turned and in the middle of the room.
- Hmm.

609
00:39:45,836 --> 00:39:47,716
No way she could've pushed it there...

610
00:39:47,717 --> 00:39:48,761
Mm-hmm.

611
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:51,906
And so I put it back, and then she woke
up screaming about a half-hour later,

612
00:39:51,907 --> 00:39:54,188
and it was, again, turned
and in the middle of the room.

613
00:39:54,189 --> 00:39:57,976
Interesting. That's
a pretty big movement.

614
00:39:57,977 --> 00:40:00,278
Could that be from the poltergeist?

615
00:40:00,279 --> 00:40:02,139
Yes.

616
00:40:11,046 --> 00:40:13,213
Melissa, I know tonight
was pretty rough.

617
00:40:13,214 --> 00:40:17,376
You heard a lot of things that
you probably didn't want to hear.

618
00:40:17,377 --> 00:40:19,720
But the big question is your children.

619
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:22,282
- Right.
- Is it safe for them to be raised here?

620
00:40:22,283 --> 00:40:27,083
With that, I'm gonna
turn that over to Amy.

621
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:35,992
You have a lot of dead
around this location.

622
00:40:35,993 --> 00:40:39,165
So the first thing you need
to do is grief counseling.

623
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:41,401
This is going to allow
you to let go of the dead

624
00:40:41,402 --> 00:40:44,837
and to process emotions
in a beneficial way.

625
00:40:44,838 --> 00:40:48,091
This will also help you
get rid of the poltergeist.

626
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:52,099
For Nathan, something he should do
every night before he goes to bed,

627
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,539
is to have him state that,

628
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:59,124
he only allows the good dead and
guides to stand by him and help him.

629
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:01,107
He has that power,

630
00:41:01,108 --> 00:41:06,327
and the good guides and the good dead are
going to be pushing the bad out, as well.

631
00:41:06,328 --> 00:41:10,948
- Will that get Looney out of here?
- Yes.

632
00:41:12,872 --> 00:41:16,735
The last thing is you
can go to the tribe...

633
00:41:16,736 --> 00:41:22,636
That Keokuk is from, and ask them
to do a ceremony in your backyard.

634
00:41:23,035 --> 00:41:28,315
To release him and the
people that he's imprisoned.

635
00:41:28,716 --> 00:41:30,357
I feel really good about it.

636
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:34,331
I'm anxious to start
helping Nathan and...

637
00:41:34,332 --> 00:41:38,352
Get rid of these negative energies.

638
00:41:40,294 --> 00:41:42,925
We have a game plan now. For
me, I feel like a puzzle has

639
00:41:42,926 --> 00:41:45,131
been put together in front
of me, to be honest with you.

640
00:41:45,132 --> 00:41:46,800
But are you gonna follow Amy's advice?

641
00:41:46,801 --> 00:41:48,134
Definitely. Yeah.

642
00:41:48,135 --> 00:41:50,415
Absolutely.

643
00:41:52,573 --> 00:41:54,607
Melissa has a lot of work ahead of her

644
00:41:54,608 --> 00:41:57,958
to rid her property of
the evil that resides here.

645
00:41:57,959 --> 00:42:01,383
But once she confronts her
past and follows my advice.

646
00:42:01,384 --> 00:42:07,284
I'm confident that her family
will be able to live in peace.
