1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:05,396 --> 00:00:08,831
It feels like we're on its territory.

3
00:00:08,832 --> 00:00:11,279
It's pissed.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,633
My daughter just told me she was gonna die.

5
00:00:13,634 --> 00:00:16,169
It's bad. There was blood all over.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,778
Do you have any idea how they died?

7
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:20,912
It crashed head on into the
waiting freight train.

8
00:00:20,913 --> 00:00:24,015
I hear something snap, crunch.

9
00:00:24,016 --> 00:00:25,549
I would burn this place to the ground.

10
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,451
There's warfare going on.

11
00:00:27,452 --> 00:00:30,421
They want to kill me.

12
00:00:30,422 --> 00:00:33,542
We shouldn't be here.

13
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:37,991
They're being watched.

14
00:00:37,992 --> 00:00:41,065
My name is Amy Allan.

15
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:43,267
This thing likes death.

16
00:00:43,268 --> 00:00:44,866
I see dead people.

17
00:00:44,867 --> 00:00:46,507
This thing's, like, a monster.

18
00:00:46,508 --> 00:00:48,542
I speak to dead people.

19
00:00:48,543 --> 00:00:50,207
And he's pissed off now.

20
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:51,693
And they speak to me.

21
00:00:51,694 --> 00:00:53,313
His head was cracked.

22
00:00:53,314 --> 00:00:56,981
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

23
00:00:56,982 --> 00:00:58,049
This guy was murdered.

24
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,845
I rely on my partner.

25
00:00:59,846 --> 00:01:03,146
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

26
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:05,957
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

27
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:09,103
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

28
00:01:09,104 --> 00:01:10,506
You saw her?

29
00:01:10,507 --> 00:01:11,929
It's my job to reveal them.

30
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:12,997
Why would you stay here?

31
00:01:12,998 --> 00:01:15,172
But Steve and I never speak...

32
00:01:15,173 --> 00:01:17,048
We never communicate
during an investigation.

33
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:18,442
Until the very end.

34
00:01:18,443 --> 00:01:20,375
Stop it.

35
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:22,519
We uncover if it's safe for you to stay...

36
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,815
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

37
00:01:24,816 --> 00:01:26,130
Or time to get out.

38
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:30,811
I told you there were ghosts in this house.

39
00:01:51,448 --> 00:01:56,188
Amy and I work independently
of one another.

40
00:01:56,223 --> 00:02:02,123
I gather evidence, interview witnesses, and
dig into the history of each location.

41
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:08,017
When we're done, we reveal our findings
to the clients and each other.

42
00:02:08,018 --> 00:02:13,555
I'm down in Browns Summit, North
Carolina, just outside of Greensboro.

43
00:02:13,556 --> 00:02:17,493
I'm on my way to meet a woman named Sheila.
She sounds scared to death.

44
00:02:17,494 --> 00:02:21,407
She says something in the house is
making her family sick, and even worse,

45
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:24,188
it's attacking her daughter,
who has special needs.

46
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:28,629
I'm hoping Amy and I can help her out.

47
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:34,617
Before Amy arrives,

48
00:02:34,618 --> 00:02:38,331
I look for anything that could
influence her findings.

49
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:40,568
This is clearly a family's home,

50
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:45,404
so I have to remove all the
photographs and personal items...

51
00:02:45,405 --> 00:02:49,905
To clear the location for tonight's walk.

52
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:09,342
My opening... I went to the graveyard,

53
00:03:09,343 --> 00:03:15,243
and I saw there was a swing, and
there was a little boy on it.

54
00:03:17,038 --> 00:03:18,938
Then this older man comes in.

55
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:20,540
He's like in his 60s.

56
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:23,914
And he just comes up to him and smacks him.

57
00:03:23,915 --> 00:03:28,235
And then he starts beating the kid up.

58
00:03:29,183 --> 00:03:33,337
But while he's doing that, he,
like, morphs into a younger man.

59
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:37,178
There was abuse towards children.

60
00:03:37,228 --> 00:03:40,646
I don't like this area, though.

61
00:03:40,647 --> 00:03:43,167
This was bad.

62
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:54,811
Well, Sheila, now that I'm here,

63
00:03:54,812 --> 00:03:57,201
why don't you tell me a little
bit about what's going on?

64
00:03:57,202 --> 00:04:00,113
Well, we've been here for 25 years.

65
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:00,958
Okay.

66
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,859
And we've always noticed footsteps in the
house, hearing things, seeing things.

67
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:12,906
And then my daughter Amber started getting
sick, and then Carrie was born sick.

68
00:04:12,907 --> 00:04:14,327
Carrie is special-needs.

69
00:04:14,328 --> 00:04:18,493
She's had 19 surgeries, and 14 of
those have been brain surgeries.

70
00:04:18,494 --> 00:04:19,504
Oh, geez.

71
00:04:19,505 --> 00:04:24,743
But since a few months ago, it's
just taken a very negative turn.

72
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:26,238
Okay, in what way?

73
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,989
It's becoming very physical.

74
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,613
Carrie has been seeing things.

75
00:04:31,614 --> 00:04:37,010
She kept saying she was gonna be
whipped and she was gonna be burned.

76
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:41,222
She has visions of being nailed to a cross.

77
00:04:41,223 --> 00:04:43,732
She's terrified to open her eyes.

78
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:44,909
Okay.

79
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,626
Just the other night, she
hadn't spoke all day,

80
00:04:47,627 --> 00:04:51,689
and the only thing she said was, "ghost".

81
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,829
She's terrified.

82
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,906
If my partner, Amy, told you, "you got to
get out of this house," what would you do?

83
00:04:57,907 --> 00:05:00,140
We can't afford to leave.

84
00:05:00,141 --> 00:05:02,154
We're very spiritual people,

85
00:05:02,155 --> 00:05:06,047
and I really do believe that we're
dealing with something evil.

86
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:08,813
But we're determined to get through this.

87
00:05:08,814 --> 00:05:10,734
Okay.

88
00:05:15,992 --> 00:05:18,392
Oh, my God.

89
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,264
What do you see?

90
00:05:23,265 --> 00:05:25,905
This dog thing.

91
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,910
I can feel it, like, pushing
on me, like, panting.

92
00:05:32,911 --> 00:05:36,091
Like, kind of growling.

93
00:05:38,568 --> 00:05:41,906
What sort of things can it do to people?

94
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:46,893
I think it's one of these
dogs that kill people.

95
00:05:46,894 --> 00:05:51,255
I've never encountered anything like this.

96
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:54,182
It looks like a mythical
creature from hell.

97
00:05:54,183 --> 00:05:56,557
I don't want to get any
closer because I have no

98
00:05:56,558 --> 00:06:00,856
idea what this thing is
capable of doing to us.

99
00:06:00,857 --> 00:06:02,789
I mean, it's all black...

100
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,390
Real solid black, real thick.

101
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:10,966
My heart's pounding because I'm nervous.

102
00:06:13,515 --> 00:06:16,417
So, why did you bring me into this room?

103
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,797
I wanted to show you a picture of Carrie.

104
00:06:19,798 --> 00:06:22,382
This was taken a few months ago.

105
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:23,783
Okay.

106
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:27,264
That's your typical Carrie.

107
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:28,766
She's pretty.

108
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:31,992
She's very happy. But this
is why we called you.

109
00:06:31,993 --> 00:06:33,793
Oh.

110
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:40,788
She woke up that morning, and when
I saw that, I was just terrified.

111
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:42,804
Was there anything in the
room that she could have

112
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:46,871
- grabbed and done this to herself?
- No, because she is in such a state...

113
00:06:46,872 --> 00:06:49,763
That she's so out of it, no.

114
00:06:49,764 --> 00:06:53,148
And the thing is, I had
just trimmed her nails.

115
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:57,047
There were no hangnails. There was
nothing that could have done that.

116
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:59,282
Oh, my God. This poor kid.

117
00:06:59,283 --> 00:07:03,189
And she's had scratches since
that picture was taken...

118
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,971
- Just this week.
- In the same spot or a different area?

119
00:07:05,972 --> 00:07:10,302
A different area... on her left collarbone.

120
00:07:10,303 --> 00:07:15,122
And I knew she didn't do that because
I was with her the whole time.

121
00:07:15,123 --> 00:07:19,480
Anybody in the house else, besides
her, get these type of scratches?

122
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,181
No, just Carrie.

123
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:38,029
Oh [Bleep]!

124
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,860
There is crying in here.

125
00:07:47,765 --> 00:07:49,832
There's crying from the bed.

126
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:54,468
Weeping, weeping... not crying.
Weeping, weeping.

127
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:56,531
I'm not sure why.

128
00:07:56,532 --> 00:08:01,878
- Can you tell who's doing it?
- It might be a living person.

129
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,863
Female.

130
00:08:03,864 --> 00:08:07,464
Very sad. Like, such sadness.

131
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:16,287
- So, Sheila, is this your bedroom?
- Yes.

132
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,687
Okay, so what's going on in here?

133
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:23,668
She's... she's crying,
if you're hearing that.

134
00:08:29,195 --> 00:08:33,543
Okay, so she's in this constant state of
anxiety and depression, I guess, right?

135
00:08:33,544 --> 00:08:37,113
Constant state of that and
constant state of seeing things.

136
00:08:37,114 --> 00:08:40,031
She just told me she was gonna die.

137
00:08:40,032 --> 00:08:42,552
Now, how do you try to calm her
down when she's like that?

138
00:08:42,553 --> 00:08:46,813
It's very difficult to keep her calm.

139
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:51,047
- It's breaking my heart.
- It's killing us.

140
00:08:51,048 --> 00:08:53,930
She's a really good, genuine person.

141
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:57,754
And I tell her all the time,
"Carrie, you are a light to people".

142
00:08:57,755 --> 00:08:59,189
Right.

143
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:04,145
So we have to remind ourselves
of the old Carrie...

144
00:09:04,146 --> 00:09:07,143
And keep telling ourselves
she will come back.

145
00:09:07,144 --> 00:09:08,611
Okay.

146
00:09:08,612 --> 00:09:12,016
So, is there anything specific
happening to you in this room?

147
00:09:12,017 --> 00:09:15,506
I did see an apparition... a girl.

148
00:09:15,507 --> 00:09:18,008
I saw her go from...

149
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:21,958
This area all the way out
and into the living room.

150
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,557
Okay, did she look at you, or...

151
00:09:24,558 --> 00:09:26,438
- No.
- All right.

152
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:29,665
But also, quite often, when
I have to come lay down,

153
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,789
I will feel pressing on the bed.

154
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,791
- Like somebody's sitting?
- Right.

155
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:38,479
It feels like someone is leaning
on the bed just to aggravate me.

156
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,876
That's interesting.

157
00:09:39,877 --> 00:09:43,279
It's gotten so bad. One day, I was
in here, and I was really sick.

158
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,650
And I just swatted my hand out
and just said, "leave me alone".

159
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:49,952
What do you think's going on in this house?

160
00:09:49,953 --> 00:09:53,327
I don't know at this point.

161
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:57,046
But I'm wondering if it's following Carrie.

162
00:09:57,047 --> 00:09:58,967
Okay.

163
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:08,510
There is a child running, running,
running, running, running, running.

164
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,772
You know, like, freaking
hyperactive as [Bleep].

165
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:14,593
This kid is nuts.

166
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:24,630
I do feel like this... the
top of this bed's involved.

167
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:29,325
I don't know if the kid's
jumping up on there.

168
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:33,205
This kid is running all over the place,
but all you see is this white light.

169
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:36,566
You just see the white light and the
streaks and stuff. You know what I mean?

170
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:40,621
So what kind of experience would
somebody in the bed have?

171
00:10:40,622 --> 00:10:45,838
The bed would shake, and
they'd feel the pressure.

172
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,119
It's bad.

173
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:53,119
It wants to do creepy [Bleep] to people.

174
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:21,234
Now, your wife explained some of the things
that she's experienced in the house.

175
00:11:21,235 --> 00:11:23,204
How about yourself, are you
experiencing anything?

176
00:11:23,205 --> 00:11:26,820
Yeah, through the years, I'd hear what
sounded to me like bare footsteps...

177
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:28,843
"Boom, boom, boom"... up
and down the hallway.

178
00:11:28,844 --> 00:11:31,178
90% of the time, I'd open
the door to check...

179
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:32,514
Nobody there.

180
00:11:32,515 --> 00:11:35,156
So, Jimmy, what do you know about the land

181
00:11:35,157 --> 00:11:37,284
or the property the house was built on?

182
00:11:37,285 --> 00:11:40,087
Well, I know the house was built in 1902.

183
00:11:40,088 --> 00:11:43,023
- Okay.
- And that it was part of the Rudd farm.

184
00:11:43,024 --> 00:11:47,261
My grandparents moved in sometime
in the early to mid '50s.

185
00:11:47,262 --> 00:11:49,410
So you've been around
this house a long time?

186
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:51,198
Pretty much my whole life, yes.

187
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:54,301
But recently, it's gotten more violent,

188
00:11:54,302 --> 00:11:57,371
or it just seems like the
girls are being picked on.

189
00:11:57,372 --> 00:11:59,803
See, that's what pushed
us to contact you guys.

190
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:05,084
Carrie is such an innocent
person, and why she's...

191
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:08,482
Attacked...

192
00:12:08,483 --> 00:12:10,985
She's been through a lot her whole life,

193
00:12:10,986 --> 00:12:15,546
and it just seems to get worse and worse.

194
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:18,159
Her whole personality's changed.

195
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,265
She's gotten to where we've had to...

196
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:23,831
Spoon-feed her, where
she was a vibrant girl.

197
00:12:23,832 --> 00:12:26,991
Loved to run and play, life of the party.

198
00:12:26,992 --> 00:12:31,681
She said, "daddy, I don't
have laugh in me anymore".

199
00:12:31,682 --> 00:12:35,916
It just grieves me to see
her suffer like this.

200
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:40,670
And it's not just her. Her sister
is experiencing things, too.

201
00:12:40,671 --> 00:12:44,406
Jimmy, let me ask you a question. What
do you think is actually going on here?

202
00:12:44,407 --> 00:12:47,822
We know that there's
spiritual warfare going on.

203
00:12:47,823 --> 00:12:51,593
It seems like the ones that are
hurt the most are the innocents.

204
00:12:51,594 --> 00:12:52,627
Right.

205
00:12:52,628 --> 00:12:56,768
And she's as innocent as they come.

206
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:07,108
I'm seeing this dog thing again.

207
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:10,310
While I was watching it, it
freaking changed shape three times,

208
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:14,393
you know, from a dog to a human to a...

209
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:17,782
Really tall creature thing.

210
00:13:17,783 --> 00:13:22,456
Even though it scared me, I'm going to try
and learn more about this bizarre creature.

211
00:13:22,457 --> 00:13:26,427
All I know right now is that it can
change shape and it's very territorial.

212
00:13:26,428 --> 00:13:31,021
It doesn't want people
on its land, its space.

213
00:13:31,022 --> 00:13:36,337
I mean, it's all over here, back
there, back there, back there.

214
00:13:36,338 --> 00:13:38,806
Is this something that could
do anything to people?

215
00:13:38,807 --> 00:13:41,829
Yeah, I think it could.

216
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,850
I don't know yet what it can do.

217
00:13:46,048 --> 00:13:49,408
I wouldn't go out there.

218
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:58,559
So, Amber, I was talking to Mom, and she
was explaining what's going on here.

219
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,681
So I wanted to talk to you to find
out what you're experiencing.

220
00:14:02,682 --> 00:14:04,532
This place um...

221
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:08,469
Ever since we moved in,
I've been really tired.

222
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:12,206
So it definitely affects me physically.

223
00:14:12,207 --> 00:14:14,476
And certain rooms are worse than others.

224
00:14:14,477 --> 00:14:18,357
- Which room is worse for you?
- My sister's room.

225
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:24,006
She's the most important person
in the whole world to me.

226
00:14:24,007 --> 00:14:26,289
It's just not fair.

227
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,890
I'm supposed to protect her.

228
00:14:30,877 --> 00:14:34,380
I can't protect her from this.

229
00:14:34,381 --> 00:14:37,863
Do you think she understands
what's going on?

230
00:14:37,864 --> 00:14:39,172
No.

231
00:14:39,173 --> 00:14:40,302
No.

232
00:14:40,303 --> 00:14:42,330
Definitely not.

233
00:14:42,331 --> 00:14:46,507
I gave her a hug, and she managed to say...

234
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:49,028
"I love you".

235
00:14:49,745 --> 00:14:54,270
I thought in my head, "that's the last
time I'm gonna hear her say that".

236
00:14:54,271 --> 00:14:59,467
I'm so worried about her that I
don't care what it throws at me.

237
00:14:59,468 --> 00:15:01,828
- Okay.
- I'm not afraid.

238
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:05,572
I'm not afraid of it
anymore because I know...

239
00:15:05,573 --> 00:15:10,616
Whatever it is is a coward
if it's picking on her.

240
00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:13,317
And I've asked.

241
00:15:13,374 --> 00:15:16,095
- What do you mean you've asked?
- I said...

242
00:15:16,096 --> 00:15:20,476
"Whatever you are, you leave her alone".

243
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,668
"She's defenseless.

244
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:26,569
You come to me. I can take it".

245
00:15:34,874 --> 00:15:38,234
I think it went in here.

246
00:15:38,741 --> 00:15:41,180
I do see it.

247
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:42,685
What?

248
00:15:42,686 --> 00:15:45,626
Uh, this dog thing.

249
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:51,964
It's very upset. It doesn't...

250
00:15:51,965 --> 00:15:55,193
Doesn't want us up there, doesn't want...

251
00:15:55,194 --> 00:15:59,634
Us in here, doesn't want us doing this.

252
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:02,970
It's definitely enraged.

253
00:16:02,971 --> 00:16:07,873
It definitely feels like
we shouldn't be here.

254
00:16:07,874 --> 00:16:12,194
Like we're on its territory right now.

255
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,418
It's pissed.

256
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,380
When I'm alone in this room,

257
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:24,861
I get a very dark feeling.

258
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,418
It's just, like, a heaviness...

259
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,583
A heaviness that feels like it's,

260
00:16:29,584 --> 00:16:33,521
pressing down on you and making you...

261
00:16:33,522 --> 00:16:36,342
Exhausted and sad.

262
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:39,872
- Do you want to move?
- I would love to move.

263
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,266
- You would?
- I would move right now.

264
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:45,354
I would burn this place to the ground.

265
00:16:45,355 --> 00:16:49,138
I'd light the match. It
doesn't need to exist.

266
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:54,419
I don't feel like anybody
will ever be happy here.

267
00:17:08,647 --> 00:17:13,649
Jimmy mentioned that his property used to
be part of a farm owned by the Rudd family.

268
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,086
I've managed to track down
one of its descendants,

269
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:18,755
and he tells me that the
family's time on that property

270
00:17:18,756 --> 00:17:22,176
was filled with heartbreak.

271
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:32,135
I growed up on the farm right here.

272
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:33,809
How big was the farm?

273
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,090
999 acres.

274
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:38,561
Now, growing up, did you
work on the farm yourself?

275
00:17:38,562 --> 00:17:41,498
Oh, yeah, worked with daddy... my daddy.

276
00:17:41,499 --> 00:17:44,434
Phil, who was the first
Rudd to establish the farm?

277
00:17:44,435 --> 00:17:46,569
Seneca, my grandfather.

278
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,564
- Okay, what kind of a man was he?
- He was stern.

279
00:17:49,565 --> 00:17:53,293
All the children had their chores to do.
You had to get it done.

280
00:17:53,294 --> 00:17:55,972
- What happened if you didn't?
- We'd get some harsh words.

281
00:17:55,973 --> 00:17:59,556
Okay. I see you have a picture here.
Is this your family?

282
00:17:59,557 --> 00:18:03,298
That's my grandfather right here.

283
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,834
How many children did
your grandfather have?

284
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,751
Five boys and one girl.

285
00:18:08,752 --> 00:18:12,781
And there was two small ones
that died when they were young.

286
00:18:12,782 --> 00:18:14,430
Do you know who they were?

287
00:18:14,431 --> 00:18:16,399
- There was Elmer.
- Okay.

288
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,502
- And Mary Kitty.
- Mary Kitty.

289
00:18:18,503 --> 00:18:21,269
- How old was Elmer?
- Elmer was 8 years old.

290
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,923
8 years old. Do you know how old
Mary Kitty might have been?

291
00:18:23,924 --> 00:18:26,225
She's somewhere between 6 to 10.

292
00:18:26,226 --> 00:18:28,828
Do you have any idea, Phil, how they died?

293
00:18:28,829 --> 00:18:31,409
No, I do not.

294
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:42,063
I definitely think that there is a...

295
00:18:42,064 --> 00:18:45,074
Dead little boy here.

296
00:18:45,075 --> 00:18:48,422
- How old?
- Maybe like 8 or 9?

297
00:18:48,423 --> 00:18:49,987
He...

298
00:18:49,988 --> 00:18:53,108
Does a lot of chores.

299
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:00,979
Do you know how he died?

300
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:11,919
He fell down. He was running,

301
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,040
and he fell down bad.

302
00:19:15,602 --> 00:19:19,219
Like, I can hear something
snap, crunch, you know?

303
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,280
Like, I can feel it.

304
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,500
Your grandfather... Where's he buried?

305
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,136
He is buried at Lees Chapel.

306
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:34,839
He died at Rudd Station.

307
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,882
Phil, what was Rudd Station?

308
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:41,996
It was just a flagpole where trains
stopped to pick up passengers.

309
00:19:41,997 --> 00:19:43,775
It was right beside the property.

310
00:19:43,776 --> 00:19:45,609
Okay, so it was right at
the edge of the land?

311
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:46,849
Yeah.

312
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,408
Do you know any of the station's history?

313
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:52,093
- There was a train wreck.
- Okay.

314
00:19:52,094 --> 00:19:53,714
In 1907, I think it was.

315
00:19:53,715 --> 00:19:55,814
You don't know what caused
it or anything like that?

316
00:19:55,815 --> 00:19:57,674
- No, I do not.
- Okay.

317
00:19:57,675 --> 00:19:59,385
I know the fireman died.

318
00:19:59,386 --> 00:20:01,506
- Okay.
- That's all I know.

319
00:20:01,507 --> 00:20:05,692
And they said his ghost would
come back every so often.

320
00:20:05,693 --> 00:20:08,633
- They did?
- Yeah.

321
00:20:15,362 --> 00:20:18,487
I'm gonna need to find out a lot
more about this train accident

322
00:20:18,488 --> 00:20:21,042
that happened right on Jimmy
and Sheila's property.

323
00:20:21,043 --> 00:20:23,533
I'm heading over to meet with
a transportation historian

324
00:20:23,534 --> 00:20:27,974
who says he knows all about the tragedy.

325
00:20:32,855 --> 00:20:36,358
So, Walter, what can you
tell me about this crash?

326
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:39,479
On October 17, 1907...

327
00:20:39,852 --> 00:20:43,141
Late at night, a freight
train was coming south,

328
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:46,517
on the main lines and
pulled off on the siding

329
00:20:46,518 --> 00:20:49,000
for the northbound passenger train.

330
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:52,377
And while the freight train was
waiting for the passenger train,

331
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:55,610
Henry Clay Leonard, who was the brakeman...

332
00:20:55,611 --> 00:20:57,637
He fell asleep.

333
00:20:57,638 --> 00:21:01,349
And then all of a sudden, he heard the
whistle of the approaching train.

334
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:06,846
And he just woke up, and he was startled,
and he rushed over to the switch...

335
00:21:06,847 --> 00:21:09,792
And by mistake, he opened the switch.

336
00:21:09,793 --> 00:21:12,991
So that the passenger train,
instead of passing by,

337
00:21:12,992 --> 00:21:17,912
crashed head on into the
waiting freight train.

338
00:21:20,969 --> 00:21:22,480
Did he get charged in this case?

339
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:26,040
Yes, well, basically, he
ran away from the wreck.

340
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,037
- He knew it was his fault.
- Okay.

341
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:30,245
So he was devastated.

342
00:21:30,246 --> 00:21:35,383
And he ended up walking the 60 miles
back to Spencer, where he lived.

343
00:21:35,384 --> 00:21:37,805
So what did they do,
eventually catch up to him?

344
00:21:37,806 --> 00:21:43,061
Yeah, he was arrested and charged, and it
really just ruined his life, you know?

345
00:21:43,062 --> 00:21:47,022
He was never the same after that.

346
00:21:48,698 --> 00:21:53,401
There's this guy, and
he's really messed up.

347
00:21:53,402 --> 00:21:55,964
Like, he's disoriented.

348
00:21:55,965 --> 00:22:00,350
He, I think, had been walking
for a very long time.

349
00:22:00,351 --> 00:22:04,491
He didn't look real good, you know?

350
00:22:06,014 --> 00:22:08,283
His feet do hurt.

351
00:22:08,284 --> 00:22:10,218
His back hurts.

352
00:22:10,219 --> 00:22:13,519
He's in a lot of pain.

353
00:22:16,603 --> 00:22:22,503
Two trains collided, and there
was this huge mashing of steel.

354
00:22:22,886 --> 00:22:27,553
And there was fires, people
groaning and yelling.

355
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:32,039
And here's some articles
about it right here.

356
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,653
How many people got killed?

357
00:22:33,654 --> 00:22:35,665
- Three people got killed right away.
- Okay.

358
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:39,746
And two or three others died later.

359
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:45,939
Um...

360
00:22:47,969 --> 00:22:50,042
There's some dead people out there.

361
00:22:50,043 --> 00:22:52,127
There's a skull out there.

362
00:22:52,128 --> 00:22:55,668
Like, I do see dead bodies.

363
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:00,802
- How many?
- A bunch.

364
00:23:00,803 --> 00:23:05,340
There was blood all over,
and they looked a mess.

365
00:23:05,341 --> 00:23:08,761
Do you know what happened?

366
00:23:10,546 --> 00:23:12,586
Uh-oh.

367
00:23:12,704 --> 00:23:16,304
I think they all got killed.

368
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,573
I'm at the local library to find out

369
00:23:32,574 --> 00:23:35,715
more about this Rudd
station train disaster.

370
00:23:35,716 --> 00:23:38,687
But after looking through
some old newspaper articles,

371
00:23:38,688 --> 00:23:43,088
I find something else that
really turns my stomach.

372
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:47,675
In 1956, along the same train line that
runs through my clients' property,

373
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:52,548
there was a bombing that
devastated a local church.

374
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:57,119
But the records don't
say who's responsible.

375
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,669
I'm on my way to meet with a
local journalist who says it

376
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:05,570
was one of the biggest unsolved
crimes in the town's history.

377
00:24:12,635 --> 00:24:14,663
I came across this article
about a church bombing

378
00:24:14,664 --> 00:24:17,839
that took place right near the
property I'm investigating

379
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,719
back in November 5, 1956.

380
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,747
- Can you tell me anything about it?
- It was at 8:00 at night.

381
00:24:23,748 --> 00:24:27,705
And four sticks of dynamite were
tossed into the church, and phew!

382
00:24:27,706 --> 00:24:30,653
- It just exploded.
- Who the hell would do this?

383
00:24:30,654 --> 00:24:34,656
Well, I would bet my last
dollar it was the Ku Klux Klan.

384
00:24:34,657 --> 00:24:38,679
- What would be the reason for doing this?
- This was a black church...

385
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,782
Okay.

386
00:24:39,783 --> 00:24:43,848
And the day before the November
6th election of that year.

387
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:48,405
They could have been trying to intimidate
black voters in that part of the County...

388
00:24:48,406 --> 00:24:50,805
Or the whole County, for that matter.

389
00:24:50,806 --> 00:24:53,070
- This was a time when integration...
- Right.

390
00:24:53,071 --> 00:24:56,513
Was taking over in the south,
and people were upset.

391
00:24:56,514 --> 00:25:00,815
The odd thing was that four men
came after the dynamiting,

392
00:25:00,816 --> 00:25:05,702
and one of them went up to look in
there, maybe to see what their work did.

393
00:25:05,703 --> 00:25:10,025
And as one of them was looking into
the building with a flashlight,

394
00:25:10,026 --> 00:25:13,162
a man that was, apparently,
you know, standing guard,

395
00:25:13,163 --> 00:25:16,431
came up to him with a shotgun,
and they all ran off.

396
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:21,112
As far as I know, nobody was ever arrested.

397
00:25:22,672 --> 00:25:28,572
There are these dudes out there. There
is about three or four of them.

398
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,947
They're not good.

399
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,948
They are scaring me.

400
00:25:37,487 --> 00:25:40,755
They were running away from
something they were afraid of.

401
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:44,836
They ran here for safety, and so...

402
00:25:44,904 --> 00:25:48,504
They are making me nervous...

403
00:25:48,829 --> 00:25:51,589
To go out there.

404
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:57,005
Do you have any idea what
they're hiding from?

405
00:25:57,006 --> 00:25:59,134
They were hiding from other men.

406
00:25:59,135 --> 00:26:03,812
I don't think that the four men
got along, either, though.

407
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:05,543
They're all bad.

408
00:26:05,544 --> 00:26:07,583
They want to kill me.

409
00:26:07,584 --> 00:26:10,524
I don't like them.

410
00:26:11,354 --> 00:26:14,714
I got to go back inside.

411
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:19,328
Did something like this ever happen before?

412
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:20,871
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

413
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:24,733
25 years earlier, I believe,
the church burned down.

414
00:26:24,734 --> 00:26:27,102
And so did the school beside it.

415
00:26:27,103 --> 00:26:29,208
- The same church?
- Same church.

416
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:32,597
- The school was a black school.
- What kind of damage are we talking about?

417
00:26:32,598 --> 00:26:35,923
Well, it destroyed the church.
It knocked out the roof.

418
00:26:35,924 --> 00:26:39,281
Uh, destroyed the pews, damaged the walls.

419
00:26:39,282 --> 00:26:40,982
Did anybody get killed in this or hurt?

420
00:26:40,983 --> 00:26:43,952
No, nobody was hurt.
There was nobody there.

421
00:26:43,953 --> 00:26:46,773
So we were lucky.

422
00:27:00,403 --> 00:27:03,427
There's, like, these children, and
this woman's, like, teaching them,

423
00:27:03,428 --> 00:27:07,445
and there's this man, and he's,
like, preaching at them.

424
00:27:07,446 --> 00:27:10,106
And then I do see smoke.

425
00:27:10,107 --> 00:27:12,660
In this white little building,

426
00:27:12,661 --> 00:27:15,781
and people are crying.

427
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:23,019
But I'm seeing it from a distance,
watching this building burn.

428
00:27:30,354 --> 00:27:34,869
During my walk, I encountered a terrifying
creature that attacks the living.

429
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:40,770
I'm meeting with a sketch artist to
bring this creepy thing to life.

430
00:27:41,404 --> 00:27:44,944
The bottom half is all dog.

431
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:49,418
It was kind of leaning up against the tree.

432
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:52,899
The head was more humanoid.

433
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:01,430
Was there a shading or coloring to it?

434
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:05,151
It was very, very solid black.

435
00:28:11,238 --> 00:28:14,358
Is this what you saw?

436
00:28:15,164 --> 00:28:17,024
Yes.

437
00:28:44,886 --> 00:28:48,055
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

438
00:28:48,056 --> 00:28:50,734
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other...

439
00:28:50,735 --> 00:28:54,815
And our clients for the first time.

440
00:28:58,066 --> 00:29:00,490
Amy, I want you to meet Jimmy and Sheila.

441
00:29:00,491 --> 00:29:04,534
They own this home, and I think of all the
times we've been doing our investigations,

442
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:07,436
I've never met a family that
needed our help more than them.

443
00:29:07,437 --> 00:29:09,938
They've all seen a lot. They're
all going through something,

444
00:29:09,939 --> 00:29:12,148
but they believe that there's
something very evil here

445
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:15,516
and that it's actually attacking
one of the family members.

446
00:29:15,517 --> 00:29:21,417
With that, I'd like to start by Amy
telling us a little bit about her walk.

447
00:29:24,235 --> 00:29:28,315
When I was outside, I saw a skull.

448
00:29:29,026 --> 00:29:31,672
And there were all of these bodies.

449
00:29:31,673 --> 00:29:35,331
There was also a lot of blood.

450
00:29:35,332 --> 00:29:40,132
I did see one male who
was very disoriented.

451
00:29:40,232 --> 00:29:44,124
Because he had walked
and walked and walked.

452
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:46,272
That's interesting you say that because,

453
00:29:46,273 --> 00:29:50,782
this was once part of a 1,000-acre
farm, owned by the Rudd family.

454
00:29:50,783 --> 00:29:53,883
But it was so big that the train
actually had to run through here.

455
00:29:53,884 --> 00:29:56,309
In 1907, there was an accident.

456
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:59,589
And the accident occurred
right here on the property.

457
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:04,153
Three people got killed immediately,
but two more died later on.

458
00:30:04,154 --> 00:30:08,336
Henry Clay Leonard, who was the brakeman
on this train who caused the accident...

459
00:30:08,337 --> 00:30:11,801
He basically started to walk
away and just kept walking.

460
00:30:11,802 --> 00:30:13,852
And he walked 60 miles to his house.

461
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,405
The next day, the cops come
by, and they lock him up.

462
00:30:16,406 --> 00:30:20,426
I didn't know anything about that.

463
00:30:22,312 --> 00:30:24,507
So, what else did you see?

464
00:30:24,508 --> 00:30:28,017
When I first opened, I saw this man,

465
00:30:28,018 --> 00:30:31,355
and he was preaching, and
there's this white building,

466
00:30:31,356 --> 00:30:34,442
and there's smoke coming out of it, and
people were crying and freaking out.

467
00:30:34,443 --> 00:30:35,647
Wow.

468
00:30:35,648 --> 00:30:38,995
There had been a black
Methodist church back in 1956.

469
00:30:38,996 --> 00:30:41,535
Right on the edge of the
Rudd farm was this church.

470
00:30:41,536 --> 00:30:44,613
Some men threw dynamite
in there and blew it up.

471
00:30:44,614 --> 00:30:48,394
I actually have a photo of it.

472
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:53,889
Somebody I talked to about this said
that 25 years before this happened,

473
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:57,564
that same church and the
school next to it burned down.

474
00:30:57,565 --> 00:31:01,086
Apparently, the KKK, they feel,
might have been involved in this.

475
00:31:01,087 --> 00:31:02,919
But nobody was ever arrested.

476
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,783
There was a part where
four men came in a car.

477
00:31:05,784 --> 00:31:08,774
It kind of looked like as if they were
trying to check out their handiwork.

478
00:31:08,775 --> 00:31:12,595
And they got approached by a guy with a
shotgun, and they wound up taking off.

479
00:31:12,596 --> 00:31:16,301
I saw four men, and they
were all bad people.

480
00:31:16,302 --> 00:31:18,059
And they made me nervous...

481
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:22,605
Just, like, the energy
that was surrounding them.

482
00:31:22,606 --> 00:31:24,340
They're not good.

483
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:27,902
They were running away from
something they were afraid of.

484
00:31:27,903 --> 00:31:31,023
They want to kill me.

485
00:31:32,816 --> 00:31:34,717
What else did you see?

486
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:37,369
I ran into a child in the backyard...

487
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,744
A little boy between the ages of 8 and 9.

488
00:31:39,745 --> 00:31:43,585
He did a lot of farming chores.

489
00:31:44,935 --> 00:31:49,317
Okay. The man that actually started
this farm was a guy named Seneca Rudd.

490
00:31:49,318 --> 00:31:51,849
This is Seneca here... the older guy.

491
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:56,494
He did have a son named Elmer that was
8 years old that died on the property.

492
00:31:56,495 --> 00:32:00,525
So I spoke to Seneca's
grandson, Phil, who's now 90.

493
00:32:00,526 --> 00:32:03,795
And he said nobody in the
family that he knew of...

494
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:07,165
Could say how Elmer uh, died.

495
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:10,512
He did say his grandfather
was a stern guy, though.

496
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:13,813
This is very interesting.

497
00:32:14,021 --> 00:32:16,695
Do you have a funny feeling about him?

498
00:32:16,696 --> 00:32:20,836
I saw this kid swinging on a swing.

499
00:32:21,411 --> 00:32:22,962
And the...

500
00:32:22,963 --> 00:32:28,723
And the old man comes up and
starts just beating the kid.

501
00:32:29,088 --> 00:32:34,660
When I came in to the house, I saw
another child who was just crazy.

502
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:39,769
And all I see is, like, this, like,
white streak, like it was running.

503
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:42,568
So I couldn't get, like,
if it was male or female.

504
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:46,004
It never stopped or showed itself to me.

505
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:50,008
I got the sense that they were siblings.

506
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:54,313
I don't have any photos of her, but the
kid I just told you about... Elmer...

507
00:32:54,314 --> 00:32:56,459
He had a sister who also died.

508
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,451
The little girl's name was Mary Kitty.

509
00:32:58,452 --> 00:33:01,877
We think she died between
the ages of 7 and 10.

510
00:33:01,878 --> 00:33:04,372
The census is screwed up at that time.

511
00:33:04,373 --> 00:33:07,091
But we do know that she
did die on the property.

512
00:33:07,092 --> 00:33:11,174
One of the things that I got that she likes
to do is in this room, in particular...

513
00:33:11,175 --> 00:33:15,904
Is uh, she would run from room
to room and get on the beds.

514
00:33:15,905 --> 00:33:19,167
Somebody would feel movement to the bed.

515
00:33:19,168 --> 00:33:23,668
This child is trying to creep people out.

516
00:33:23,956 --> 00:33:28,159
I just notice, like, at the foot
of the bed, just, like, two hands.

517
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,906
You feel someone standing
right there annoying you,

518
00:33:31,907 --> 00:33:36,587
just wanting to let you know they're there.

519
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:43,951
As soon as I walked through the
door, I heard a woman crying.

520
00:33:43,952 --> 00:33:46,953
I just felt this sadness,
like, overtake me.

521
00:33:46,954 --> 00:33:50,506
When I was in the middle bedroom,
it was very strong in there.

522
00:33:50,507 --> 00:33:53,996
I did feel like it might be a living person

523
00:33:53,997 --> 00:33:57,966
and that it was definitely a female crying.

524
00:33:57,967 --> 00:34:01,730
Jimmy and Sheila's daughter
Carrie has special needs.

525
00:34:01,731 --> 00:34:04,229
This is her here.

526
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:08,182
She's going through a tough time.

527
00:34:08,183 --> 00:34:12,383
She's just a very sweet, sweet girl.

528
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,082
But she's been in and out of
the hospital her whole life.

529
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:21,485
She's had 19 surgeries, and 14 of
those have been brain surgeries.

530
00:34:21,486 --> 00:34:27,066
And the Carrie that we have now...
She's somebody else.

531
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:31,461
Since we've been back from the
hospital, she started having these,

532
00:34:31,462 --> 00:34:33,845
just, uncontrollable sobbing sessions.

533
00:34:33,846 --> 00:34:37,732
She would see herself being
whipped, set on fire...

534
00:34:37,733 --> 00:34:41,279
Describing herself as being put
in an electric chair one time.

535
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,039
She was just sobbing and sobbing.

536
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,713
We'd have to tell her, "you're home.
It didn't ever happen".

537
00:34:46,714 --> 00:34:52,114
I've heard her sob, too. I
mean, it's heartbreaking.

538
00:34:55,752 --> 00:34:58,488
Why don't you tell Amy about the attacks?

539
00:34:58,489 --> 00:35:00,409
Uh...

540
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:05,748
Carrie has had scratches on her back in
places that we know she couldn't reach.

541
00:35:05,749 --> 00:35:09,605
Actually, I have a photo
of it so you can see.

542
00:35:09,606 --> 00:35:11,706
Oh, my!

543
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,673
And I know she didn't do it because I'm
sitting there with her the whole time.

544
00:35:17,674 --> 00:35:20,105
I don't understand what's happening to her.

545
00:35:20,106 --> 00:35:22,260
We're spiritual people,
and, you know, we pray.

546
00:35:22,261 --> 00:35:24,199
We've done everything that we can think of.

547
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,468
And yet she's just getting further
and further away from us.

548
00:35:28,469 --> 00:35:32,555
And then she was talking
about how she wanted to die.

549
00:35:32,556 --> 00:35:38,456
She knows sign language, and the other
day, she got up and signed, "die now".

550
00:35:42,498 --> 00:35:47,782
- Well, what else did you see?
- I was outside, and...

551
00:35:47,783 --> 00:35:51,184
All of a sudden, I see
this very large animal.

552
00:35:51,185 --> 00:35:53,752
I've never actually encountered one before.

553
00:35:53,753 --> 00:35:56,689
And it was a very large black dog.

554
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:01,641
So I'm watching it now from a distance,
and it proceeds to shift from a dog,

555
00:36:01,642 --> 00:36:05,031
and it then stands up on its hind legs.

556
00:36:05,032 --> 00:36:07,767
And then it started to
kind of change shape.

557
00:36:07,768 --> 00:36:12,454
So the head is now more like a human head,
but the body is still that of a dog.

558
00:36:12,455 --> 00:36:16,547
And as I'm looking at it, I was terrified.

559
00:36:16,548 --> 00:36:19,999
It's able to come in the very back bedroom.

560
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,959
- That's Amber's bedroom.
- Yeah, that's Amber's bedroom.

561
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,473
Amber had mentioned that she
wants things to come to her.

562
00:36:27,474 --> 00:36:30,651
She's actually cried out loud...

563
00:36:30,652 --> 00:36:34,956
"Take me, come on to me.
Leave my sister alone".

564
00:36:34,957 --> 00:36:38,052
Well, I did sketch it.

565
00:36:38,053 --> 00:36:40,324
I'm dying to see this sketch.

566
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:42,605
It's odd.

567
00:36:46,906 --> 00:36:48,944
Oh, God.

568
00:36:48,945 --> 00:36:51,645
Why is it here?

569
00:37:11,492 --> 00:37:13,834
I'm dying to see this sketch.

570
00:37:13,835 --> 00:37:16,115
It's odd.

571
00:37:24,137 --> 00:37:26,297
Oh, God.

572
00:37:26,585 --> 00:37:29,285
Why is it here?

573
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:34,580
I mean, those limbs don't start
till 30 feet up the tree

574
00:37:34,581 --> 00:37:37,517
or something like that, if
it's that kind of scale.

575
00:37:37,518 --> 00:37:39,978
That's huge.

576
00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:45,067
That's when it was kind of
morphing into human form.

577
00:37:45,068 --> 00:37:47,226
It's very territorial.

578
00:37:47,227 --> 00:37:52,567
What it wants, I think, is
for you not to be here.

579
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:59,647
So could this be what's
making their daughter sick?

580
00:37:59,773 --> 00:38:01,693
Yeah.

581
00:38:06,271 --> 00:38:09,081
There's so many things
here that are correlating.

582
00:38:09,082 --> 00:38:14,422
You know, we are possibly
talking about a possession.

583
00:38:15,522 --> 00:38:21,060
The fact that she experienced a
near-death-type situation...

584
00:38:21,061 --> 00:38:24,587
Your daughter's extremely open.

585
00:38:24,588 --> 00:38:29,268
And I think that's why it would enter her.

586
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,824
I know when she's looking
at me that's not her.

587
00:38:33,825 --> 00:38:38,878
I know it's someone looking
at me for the first time.

588
00:38:38,879 --> 00:38:44,517
And at one time, when she was having a
moment where she was kind of clear.

589
00:38:44,518 --> 00:38:46,586
She called me her best Mommy.

590
00:38:46,587 --> 00:38:48,567
And...

591
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:52,934
And she said... she says, "I'm
gonna miss you, my best mama".

592
00:38:52,935 --> 00:38:55,695
And so I just...

593
00:38:58,886 --> 00:39:00,939
I'm mad.

594
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,261
I'm mad.

595
00:39:02,262 --> 00:39:05,033
Because I'm very protective of my children.

596
00:39:05,034 --> 00:39:08,874
And I'm very angry that that...

597
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:12,426
Is tormenting my family.

598
00:39:12,427 --> 00:39:15,667
It makes me very angry.

599
00:39:16,632 --> 00:39:19,632
I'm like, "why us?"

600
00:39:30,937 --> 00:39:33,784
Well, I know this has been tough
for you guys to hear this,

601
00:39:33,785 --> 00:39:39,685
but now Amy can finally give you
the answers you so badly need.

602
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:45,879
Can you help Carrie? With that,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

603
00:39:48,688 --> 00:39:51,398
It's a very difficult situation,

604
00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:57,299
and it's hard for me to say that there's
definitely possession going on here.

605
00:39:57,468 --> 00:40:02,028
But your daughter might need an exorcism...

606
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:10,249
Which can be extremely
traumatic for the individual.

607
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:16,465
So that's why I'd like you
to try something else first.

608
00:40:16,466 --> 00:40:18,554
This is frankincense.

609
00:40:18,555 --> 00:40:20,719
This is what they use in many churches,

610
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,580
to dispel any negativity,
to cleanse the area.

611
00:40:25,892 --> 00:40:28,592
This is black salt.

612
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:31,822
It's extremely uh, powerful.

613
00:40:31,823 --> 00:40:35,596
Due to the process and the
blessings that it goes through.

614
00:40:35,597 --> 00:40:39,437
And this is a protection powder.

615
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,559
That was made by a Wiccan.

616
00:40:44,466 --> 00:40:50,226
This I want you to use outside
first to seal the grounds.

617
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:53,468
And then go through the
house with the salt...

618
00:40:53,469 --> 00:40:58,024
And do every single entrance
that you can conceive of.

619
00:40:58,025 --> 00:41:01,318
And then every night, you
burn your frankincense.

620
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:03,962
Do this for a week straight.

621
00:41:03,963 --> 00:41:07,267
This might be all you need.

622
00:41:07,268 --> 00:41:11,959
So if after the week, things don't
get better for Carrie, then what?

623
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,508
Then I think you would have to
go through the process of...

624
00:41:15,509 --> 00:41:18,809
Seeing about an exorcism.

625
00:41:19,105 --> 00:41:22,705
What about getting rid of the kids?

626
00:41:22,706 --> 00:41:24,423
This will do it?

627
00:41:24,424 --> 00:41:27,064
- Yeah.
- Okay.

628
00:41:27,164 --> 00:41:31,124
That's why I wanted you to come.

629
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:37,553
I have always known there
was a battle between...

630
00:41:37,554 --> 00:41:40,849
Good and evil in the house.

631
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:45,371
This is a lot to take in. At least
I feel like we got some hope.

632
00:41:45,372 --> 00:41:51,272
We're definitely gonna do this.
There's no doubt about that.

633
00:41:53,275 --> 00:41:57,079
With all the terrifying experiences
this family has been through...

634
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:01,567
I really hope they follow my advice
and use the tools I've given them.

635
00:42:01,568 --> 00:42:03,776
Carrie's a defenseless victim,

636
00:42:03,777 --> 00:42:09,405
and she depends on her family to
do what I believe they need to do.
