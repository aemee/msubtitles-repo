1
00:00:05,555 --> 00:00:07,924
He's big, and he is powerful.

2
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:10,693
He knows that there's people here.

3
00:00:10,694 --> 00:00:12,862
I was immediately freaked out.

4
00:00:12,863 --> 00:00:15,263
It is mean.

5
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:17,566
Pure hatred and anger.

6
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:19,969
It scared the living crap out of me.

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,505
It has bad intentions.

8
00:00:22,506 --> 00:00:24,908
He was diagnosed with psychosis.

9
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:27,143
- That's no way to live.
- No.

10
00:00:27,144 --> 00:00:30,211
- Are they dangerous?
- Yes, they are.

11
00:00:30,212 --> 00:00:32,852
They're cursed.

12
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,963
They're being watched.

13
00:00:35,964 --> 00:00:38,988
My name is Amy Allan.

14
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:41,190
This thing likes death.

15
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:42,809
I see dead people.

16
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,560
This thing's, like, a monster.

17
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:46,595
I speak to dead people.

18
00:00:46,596 --> 00:00:48,282
And he's pissed off now.

19
00:00:48,283 --> 00:00:49,676
And they speak to me.

20
00:00:49,677 --> 00:00:51,403
His head was cracked.

21
00:00:51,404 --> 00:00:54,904
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

22
00:00:54,905 --> 00:00:56,395
This guy was murdered.

23
00:00:56,396 --> 00:00:57,893
I rely on my partner.

24
00:00:57,894 --> 00:00:59,306
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

25
00:00:59,307 --> 00:01:01,165
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

26
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:03,879
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

27
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,216
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

28
00:01:07,217 --> 00:01:08,526
You saw her?

29
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:09,885
It's my job to reveal them.

30
00:01:09,886 --> 00:01:10,954
Why would you stay here?

31
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:13,244
But Steve and I never speak...

32
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:15,325
We never communicate
during an investigation.

33
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:16,692
Until the very end.

34
00:01:16,693 --> 00:01:18,527
Stop it.

35
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:20,359
We uncover if it's safe for you to stay...

36
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,939
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

37
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,367
Or time to get out.

38
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:29,048
I told you there were ghosts in this house.

39
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:55,468
Amy and I work on the same case, but
from two separate perspectives.

40
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:59,302
I dig into the property's past,
bringing its dark secrets to light.

41
00:01:59,303 --> 00:02:01,748
While Amy communicates with the dead.

42
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:06,669
When we're finished, we present our
findings to the clients and each other.

43
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,911
I'm in Egg Harbor, New Jersey,
just outside of Atlantic City.

44
00:02:09,912 --> 00:02:13,250
We were called in by a woman named Jessee.

45
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:15,518
She tells me her husband,
who's usually a tough guy,

46
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:18,125
is terrified to go to
certain parts of the house.

47
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:21,862
Even worse, her three small children
are starting to be affected.

48
00:02:21,863 --> 00:02:26,783
I'm hoping we can help
this young family out.

49
00:02:33,238 --> 00:02:39,138
Before Amy arrives, I need to remove
anything that could influence her findings.

50
00:02:39,312 --> 00:02:45,212
And this house is filled with photos
of a family and their young children.

51
00:02:45,902 --> 00:02:51,802
Once these items are cleared, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

52
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,055
I felt, like, this huge...

53
00:03:18,056 --> 00:03:20,756
Being behind me.

54
00:03:21,473 --> 00:03:25,919
And I thought it was a big shadow person.

55
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,200
But when I looked, I knew
that it was just a guy.

56
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:35,008
And um, he...

57
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:38,309
Wants to slit my throat.

58
00:03:50,385 --> 00:03:52,226
All right, Jess, so, when we spoke,

59
00:03:52,227 --> 00:03:54,667
you said the whole family's
having issues here.

60
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,891
- Right.
- Tell me about what's going on.

61
00:03:56,892 --> 00:04:00,324
The kids are starting to see things...
shadow figures.

62
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:03,097
My husband is completely freaked out.

63
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:04,480
And it's just escalating.

64
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:06,187
Are you getting affected by anything here?

65
00:04:06,188 --> 00:04:08,433
Yes. I see it more than most.

66
00:04:08,434 --> 00:04:11,082
You do? When you first
moved in, did you start

67
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,089
experiencing stuff, or is
this happening later on?

68
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,112
- It was immediately.
- Why did you guys stay?

69
00:04:16,113 --> 00:04:18,672
We couldn't financially afford to leave.

70
00:04:18,673 --> 00:04:21,449
I had put my life savings into the deposit,

71
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,910
and then we just couldn't go anywhere else.

72
00:04:23,911 --> 00:04:26,185
Now, the kids... how old are they?

73
00:04:26,186 --> 00:04:29,003
- 6, 4, and 2.
- What's going on with them?

74
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:32,356
My son... he will not go into
his room for any reason.

75
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:34,008
He doesn't sleep in there, nothing.

76
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:35,670
- Is he sleeping with you guys?
- Yes.

77
00:04:35,671 --> 00:04:38,349
Okay, does he ever mention why he
doesn't want to stay in his room?

78
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,452
He just says he doesn't like it. Like,
there's just someone in there with him.

79
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:43,123
What about the other kids?

80
00:04:43,124 --> 00:04:48,838
My daughter... she's been sick for
over two years, and nobody knows why.

81
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,373
Doctors didn't give you a reason?

82
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:54,797
They tested her from leukemia to
everything, and nothing ever came back...

83
00:04:54,798 --> 00:04:59,015
No ear infection, no, like,
crazy stomach thing, nothing.

84
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:01,250
It's heartbreaking, and that's
why we called you guys...

85
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:07,151
Because it's escalated to the point to
where now my kids are being affected.

86
00:05:16,072 --> 00:05:19,672
Uh, there's a sickness here.

87
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:28,047
Something bad.

88
00:05:30,046 --> 00:05:35,946
If there's gonna be anywhere where
there's a sickness, it would be here.

89
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:41,027
I don't like it at all.

90
00:05:41,505 --> 00:05:44,206
It's from the stuff...

91
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:46,307
Outside.

92
00:05:47,859 --> 00:05:51,759
It lingers here. It lingers here.

93
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:56,799
There's been this thing that has...

94
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,980
Um, always been around.

95
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:04,229
It's not just this house.

96
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,699
It follows them.

97
00:06:10,051 --> 00:06:12,331
Everywhere.

98
00:06:21,371 --> 00:06:23,248
Three months after we bought the house,

99
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:27,485
I had a dream that there was
a kid standing in my closet.

100
00:06:27,486 --> 00:06:31,306
I followed him out of the bedroom, through
the living room, into the kitchen.

101
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,093
He stopped at the basement
door, opened the door.

102
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:38,499
Went like this for me to
follow him, so I did.

103
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,199
I followed him down the first
two steps onto the landing.

104
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,301
I stopped at the landing in my dream.

105
00:06:44,302 --> 00:06:47,274
I watched him walk the rest of the
steps and turn into the basement.

106
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:48,406
Okay.

107
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,994
I woke up from my dream. I
was standing on the landing.

108
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:55,184
Like, I physically got out of the bed
and followed this kid in my sleep.

109
00:06:55,185 --> 00:06:57,106
Were you on medication at
the time for anything?

110
00:06:57,107 --> 00:06:58,181
No. Nothing.

111
00:06:58,182 --> 00:06:59,870
- Were you drinking that night?
- No.

112
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:01,938
There's nothing that would
have made you do that.

113
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:03,577
Nothing at all.

114
00:07:03,578 --> 00:07:04,957
Anything else in here?

115
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,644
I wake up because I hear people talking.

116
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:09,409
- They start out in my dream.
- Okay.

117
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,472
And then I wake up, and I still hear them.

118
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,929
So then I'll get up to go
investigate, and there's no one here.

119
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,755
It's got to be tough for
you to sleep in here.

120
00:07:16,756 --> 00:07:17,678
Yes.

121
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:21,884
And there was a time where, for a
straight year, I slept on the couch.

122
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:25,725
- That's no way to live.
- No.

123
00:07:35,341 --> 00:07:38,641
What are you looking at?

124
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:45,417
They kind of look like
little, tiny jellyfishes.

125
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:48,668
With, like, the long tentacles.

126
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,974
They're on the ceiling.
They're always moving.

127
00:07:50,975 --> 00:07:54,095
They're always around.

128
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,758
They're trying to organize
themselves to become a being.

129
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,178
What sort of things can they do to people?

130
00:08:02,179 --> 00:08:05,179
They are aggravating.

131
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:10,484
They would cause stress,
a sense of unease uh...

132
00:08:11,388 --> 00:08:13,067
Insomnia.

133
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:17,328
- Are they dangerous?
- Yes, they are.

134
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:28,418
This is the most hated room
in the house by everybody.

135
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:29,990
Okay, so what's going on down here?

136
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:32,326
My son and I were walking down the stairs.

137
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:34,694
I turned to him like two
stairs from the bottom,

138
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:40,134
and right past this doorway, a
very large, very black figure

139
00:08:40,135 --> 00:08:45,965
walked right past the door very slowly,
blacked out the light bulb completely.

140
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:50,106
Then it kept walking and disappeared.

141
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:52,979
Nobody else was down here, it
was just you and your son?

142
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,433
- Just me and him.
- The bulb couldn't be faulty...

143
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,618
- Be loose or anything like that?
- No.

144
00:08:57,619 --> 00:08:58,629
Okay, what did you do?

145
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,885
My son immediately turned
around and hauled up

146
00:09:01,886 --> 00:09:03,990
the stairs and went
screaming to his father.

147
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:08,094
I was immediately, like, freaked
out, and I ran up the steps.

148
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:13,855
I don't ever like to have my
back to the basement, ever.

149
00:09:16,204 --> 00:09:19,893
This is a thing that's been
following these people forever.

150
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:24,214
It is mean, and it has bad intentions.

151
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:28,518
There's some kind of weird
revenge thing going on here.

152
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:31,451
The man who wanted to slit my
throat will not leave me alone.

153
00:09:31,452 --> 00:09:36,398
I think he hates women and is
furious that I'm in his space.

154
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,299
It just keeps feeling like I'm
getting punched in the stomach.

155
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:50,108
This guy, he is...

156
00:09:50,109 --> 00:09:53,440
Attached to women and causes
problems in their lives.

157
00:09:53,441 --> 00:09:56,384
- Like what?
- Torments.

158
00:09:56,385 --> 00:10:01,005
Scare them. I think he tries to kill them.

159
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:17,695
It just keeps feeling like I'm
getting punched in the stomach.

160
00:10:17,696 --> 00:10:22,316
The punching in the stomach is this male...

161
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:27,233
Who, initially, I thought
was a shadow person.

162
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,712
I got to get away from this guy.

163
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,512
The guy from inside...

164
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:42,353
He is being kind of belligerent.

165
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,590
It's, like, pounding on me.

166
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,507
It's like, get the [Bleep] out.

167
00:10:50,508 --> 00:10:52,276
Like, get out of here. Get out of here.

168
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:56,297
Get out of here. Get out of here.

169
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,717
He's, like, totally wiping me.

170
00:11:00,718 --> 00:11:02,619
What do you mean?

171
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,872
Sometimes you meet the ones who really
don't want to talk, and they'll just...

172
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,824
And then you, like, try
to get into their minds,

173
00:11:07,825 --> 00:11:11,190
and then they'll just wipe you,
like it's just this blank slate.

174
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:13,611
Like there's nothing.

175
00:11:13,612 --> 00:11:17,812
That hasn't happened in a long time.

176
00:11:24,942 --> 00:11:26,810
So Fred, I was talking to your wife, Jess,

177
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,979
and she was telling me what
was going on in the house.

178
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,535
Your daughter having some ailments.

179
00:11:31,536 --> 00:11:34,184
We didn't know what it was. I don't
really talk about it that much.

180
00:11:34,185 --> 00:11:37,241
It was just a rough point in our lives.

181
00:11:37,242 --> 00:11:40,757
One of the other situations is my son.
He never sleeps in his own room.

182
00:11:40,758 --> 00:11:43,621
I don't want him to have a bad
feeling at that young of age.

183
00:11:43,622 --> 00:11:47,431
I mean, that's got to be tough for you as
a father knowing that you can't fix it.

184
00:11:47,432 --> 00:11:49,487
That's why we need your help.

185
00:11:49,488 --> 00:11:53,091
Can you show me some places in the house
where you've been experiencing things?

186
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:55,372
Absolutely.

187
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:08,352
We were coming back from a
barbecue, walking up to the house.

188
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,154
We came up on the front porch,

189
00:12:10,155 --> 00:12:12,833
and I seen a shadowy figure
appear through the curtain.

190
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:13,862
Okay.

191
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:17,127
I seen the shoulders, the head, the
outline of the whole entire body.

192
00:12:17,128 --> 00:12:20,531
- It scared the living crap out of me.
- Now, you don't look like you scare easy.

193
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:21,865
But that scared you.

194
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,501
It scared me enough where
I had to call my 4'9 wife

195
00:12:24,502 --> 00:12:26,652
to come up to the front porch
and go inside the house.

196
00:12:26,653 --> 00:12:28,593
- Really?
- Yeah.

197
00:12:28,594 --> 00:12:30,597
Is this the first time you
saw something like that?

198
00:12:30,598 --> 00:12:32,198
No.

199
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:36,228
In the kitchen, I just happened to see
a shadowy figure, again, peer over.

200
00:12:36,229 --> 00:12:38,375
He's looking at me. I'm looking at him.

201
00:12:38,376 --> 00:12:40,940
I yell at my wife thinking it's
my wife playing a joke on me.

202
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:43,476
She comes out of the bedroom
looking flustered as could be.

203
00:12:43,477 --> 00:12:46,325
I was like, what are you doing? She's
like, I'm putting the kids to bed.

204
00:12:46,326 --> 00:12:48,014
So you've seen this thing two times.

205
00:12:48,015 --> 00:12:50,284
Actually, two nights ago, I had a dream.

206
00:12:50,285 --> 00:12:54,954
And in that dream, in the corner of the
bedroom, there was a black shadowy figure.

207
00:12:54,955 --> 00:12:56,757
It almost looked like the Grim Reaper.

208
00:12:56,758 --> 00:12:59,859
And it just kind of went for me,
and I woke up at the same time.

209
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,940
I had the chills from head to toe.

210
00:13:10,204 --> 00:13:13,804
Okay, so this guy is pissed.

211
00:13:14,055 --> 00:13:15,999
Pure hatred and anger.

212
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,777
The shadowy figure that wiped my mind
doesn't want me to know anything about him.

213
00:13:19,778 --> 00:13:21,666
But I've been fighting
off his other attempts,

214
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:25,108
and I'm starting to see
what's making him so angry.

215
00:13:25,109 --> 00:13:29,519
He's mad because he feels like
he was ripped off and betrayed.

216
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,058
And the crawly things in the room...

217
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:37,282
I know he wants them to be
here, and he wants them to...

218
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,963
Come together and form a being.

219
00:13:39,964 --> 00:13:42,400
Are you talking about the
jellyfish creatures?

220
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:44,001
Yes.

221
00:13:44,002 --> 00:13:48,739
Sometimes I gather information that's so
bizarre I can hardly believe it myself.

222
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,842
But I just have to rely on what I see and
feel and hope it'll make sense later.

223
00:13:53,843 --> 00:13:57,074
And they're not good, these things.

224
00:13:57,075 --> 00:13:58,890
They're not.

225
00:13:58,891 --> 00:14:01,171
He's not.

226
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,299
How you feeling that you're here?

227
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,536
I just want to get out. I just want to
leave, I just don't like being down here.

228
00:14:13,537 --> 00:14:17,654
There's always a feeling of somebody
just behind you looking at you.

229
00:14:17,655 --> 00:14:19,926
You have that feeling you're being watched.

230
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:23,153
Talking to your wife about the basement.
She talked about the incident between...

231
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,113
Her and your son, what they saw down here.

232
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,386
I really didn't, you know,
believe it at the time.

233
00:14:28,387 --> 00:14:31,070
I don't know, but until I actually
physically had to come down here,

234
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:32,788
then I could understand.

235
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,891
Plus it bothers me that
my son has to go through

236
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:38,194
- what we're going through as grown adults.
- Right.

237
00:14:38,195 --> 00:14:41,907
I want him to have a childhood and be a
child, I don't want him to worry about...

238
00:14:41,908 --> 00:14:44,708
Is there something in his bedroom?
Is there something in this basement?

239
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:46,946
You know what? Let's get out
of here, you've been...

240
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:51,507
Nice enough to come down. I appreciate it.

241
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:56,498
I think this is his space.

242
00:14:56,615 --> 00:14:59,009
Oh, that [Bleep] will not
come and talk to me.

243
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,211
He's a [Bleep] coward.

244
00:15:01,212 --> 00:15:03,792
Such a coward.

245
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,052
But he's big, and he is
powerful, so it's weird.

246
00:15:08,053 --> 00:15:12,122
Like, he's such a [Bleep] baby. Like,
he won't talk to me or anything.

247
00:15:12,123 --> 00:15:15,963
He wants to be brutal about it.

248
00:15:18,463 --> 00:15:22,966
I think he's very capable of
inflicting pain on people.

249
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:24,368
He can touch and, you know,

250
00:15:24,369 --> 00:15:27,738
physically do anything he wants
to a person, pretty much.

251
00:15:27,739 --> 00:15:31,097
Do you have any idea why,
exactly, he's doing this?

252
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:36,438
Mm, because he made a
commitment to uh, wreak havoc.

253
00:15:36,495 --> 00:15:38,785
So he just wants to [Bleep] kill.

254
00:15:38,786 --> 00:15:43,886
And I think he wants to
do it to somebody here.

255
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:04,551
I made some calls, and I was
able to track down a woman

256
00:16:04,552 --> 00:16:07,421
who used to own the
property I'm investigating.

257
00:16:07,422 --> 00:16:10,116
She told me that she grew up
in Fred and Jessee's house,

258
00:16:10,117 --> 00:16:16,017
but that her time there was
marked with violence and tragedy.

259
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:23,569
So, Linda, I understand you grew
up in the house I'm investigating.

260
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:28,542
Yes. It was my mother and my father
and my brother, Louis, and myself.

261
00:16:28,543 --> 00:16:29,743
Okay.

262
00:16:29,744 --> 00:16:32,440
Now, you had mentioned on the
phone there was some tragedy

263
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:34,943
at home when you were living
there, what happened?

264
00:16:34,944 --> 00:16:39,864
My brother had died. I
have a picture of him.

265
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:46,060
He had committed suicide.
He had hung himself...

266
00:16:46,061 --> 00:16:48,070
- In the basement.
- In the house?

267
00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:50,283
- Yes.
- Aw, geez.

268
00:16:50,284 --> 00:16:53,697
- How old was he?
- Fourteen.

269
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:56,158
It was 1970.

270
00:16:56,564 --> 00:16:57,571
Who found him?

271
00:16:57,572 --> 00:17:02,652
My mother went down the basement,
and she found him there.

272
00:17:02,653 --> 00:17:07,279
And she yelled and asked me
to bring a knife down...

273
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,250
Because she had to cut him down.

274
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:10,647
Oh, geez.

275
00:17:10,648 --> 00:17:13,727
- Did he ever mention any problems to you?
- No.

276
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:17,358
He was a good kid. He never got
in any trouble or anything.

277
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,385
Okay now, did your parents stay there?

278
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:25,146
Yeah, but in '92, my mother
died of a rare blood disease.

279
00:17:27,204 --> 00:17:31,284
How did your father deal with that?

280
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:35,721
I lost him the day my mother died.

281
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:39,802
After that, everything went downhill.

282
00:17:40,882 --> 00:17:46,036
He said he was hearing voices and
there was people in his house.

283
00:17:46,037 --> 00:17:49,817
He was diagnosed with psychosis.

284
00:17:51,923 --> 00:17:54,994
- When your father died, how old was he?
- 87.

285
00:17:54,995 --> 00:17:56,518
- 87.
- Mm-hmm.

286
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:00,414
He was like an empty shell. That's
how I always described him.

287
00:18:00,415 --> 00:18:03,495
He was there physically, but
the man I knew he just...

288
00:18:03,496 --> 00:18:06,256
He wasn't there.

289
00:18:10,846 --> 00:18:16,486
There is, like, this old man
that's bopping around, too.

290
00:18:18,585 --> 00:18:23,604
I think this old man is,
like, in his death state.

291
00:18:23,605 --> 00:18:26,845
And he wanders mostly...

292
00:18:30,251 --> 00:18:32,641
Uh, he's confused.

293
00:18:32,642 --> 00:18:36,002
He's old. He's like 80.

294
00:18:36,109 --> 00:18:37,404
Okay.

295
00:18:37,405 --> 00:18:40,930
He does have moments of clarity where...

296
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:44,951
He knows that there's people here.

297
00:18:45,712 --> 00:18:49,264
But then he gets even more confused.

298
00:18:49,265 --> 00:18:55,165
There is activity in the closet because
he goes in there and he shrinks down.

299
00:18:58,758 --> 00:19:04,398
They look all cute and harmless,
and then they're crazy.

300
00:19:07,901 --> 00:19:11,265
Now that I've got a pretty good idea
about this home's recent history,

301
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:13,724
I need to find out a little
bit more about its past.

302
00:19:13,725 --> 00:19:17,684
So I've reached out to a local genealogist
to look through the archives.

303
00:19:17,685 --> 00:19:23,585
He tells me he's come up with
some pretty interesting stuff.

304
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:33,981
Bob, what were you able to find out
about the property I'm investigating?

305
00:19:33,982 --> 00:19:38,030
I was able to take the title
back to the mid-1850s.

306
00:19:38,031 --> 00:19:41,374
When a group of wealthy
German financiers...

307
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,401
Acquired 38,000 acres of land.

308
00:19:44,402 --> 00:19:47,260
And wanted to develop a
town that would be a

309
00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:50,209
land of opportunity for the
German immigrants to come.

310
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:53,532
All right, so, who wound up settling
on the land that I'm investigating?

311
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:54,688
Do you know that?

312
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:57,393
There were two brothers,
Ignatz and Louis Roesch.

313
00:19:57,394 --> 00:20:02,380
They were German immigrants who came over
here expecting the land of opportunity.

314
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:06,716
There was gonna be parks,
lakes, churches, schools...

315
00:20:06,717 --> 00:20:11,233
I mean, a whole town that they could
come to and raise a family in.

316
00:20:11,234 --> 00:20:13,257
Okay, so what did they
find when they got here?

317
00:20:13,258 --> 00:20:17,004
A little stark reality. I think
it was woods and mosquitoes.

318
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:20,398
They were met with very
difficult conditions.

319
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:25,286
Louis had a total of six
children, three of which died.

320
00:20:25,287 --> 00:20:28,106
One of them was an infant.

321
00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:31,643
Louis, died 9 years old
by double pneumonia.

322
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:35,842
And then a son, William, died
when he was 26 of enteritis.

323
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:40,587
And I brought the death
certificate of William there.

324
00:20:40,588 --> 00:20:44,507
If they would have had the hospitals
and the proper medical attention,

325
00:20:44,508 --> 00:20:46,558
they could have done something different.

326
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,949
- Sounds like he got screwed over.
- Yes.

327
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,848
Can't imagine this is the life he dreamt
of when he left his home country.

328
00:20:53,849 --> 00:20:55,769
Okay.

329
00:20:58,594 --> 00:21:02,534
This man, who I thought
was a shadow person...

330
00:21:02,535 --> 00:21:07,995
He's, like, hiding. And he
doesn't want to come out.

331
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:12,889
He's not talking to me, and this
is all coming from his mind.

332
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,258
I'm determined to get into
this dead man's head.

333
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:18,520
He's so violent and unpredictable
that I think he's responsible

334
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:22,351
for whatever the people in
this house are going through.

335
00:21:22,352 --> 00:21:26,360
There was something with money
and him and even his family.

336
00:21:26,361 --> 00:21:29,742
I don't know. Like, something from...

337
00:21:29,743 --> 00:21:31,702
A long time ago.

338
00:21:31,703 --> 00:21:34,334
Do you have any idea when this was?

339
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:36,392
Probably, like, 1850s.

340
00:21:36,393 --> 00:21:38,890
I don't even know if it's
in this freaking country.

341
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:42,431
He felt betrayed, he felt...

342
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:45,689
Double-crossed.

343
00:21:53,205 --> 00:21:56,265
Why would he haunt...

344
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,964
And be trying to get revenge?

345
00:21:59,965 --> 00:22:04,285
They're cursed, really. They're cursed.

346
00:22:08,987 --> 00:22:10,847
Yes.

347
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,908
I'm at the library to see if I can find

348
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:31,699
anything more about Fred
and Jessee's property.

349
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:37,600
I don't get any direct hits, but
one article catches my attention.

350
00:22:38,573 --> 00:22:44,217
Turns out there used to be a
sanitarium right near their house.

351
00:22:44,218 --> 00:22:47,086
But the records about what
went on there are limited.

352
00:22:47,087 --> 00:22:48,755
So I've reached out to a local historian.

353
00:22:48,756 --> 00:22:50,738
He tells me that the sanitarium

354
00:22:50,739 --> 00:22:56,619
is one of the most amazing
stories in Egg Harbor's history.

355
00:23:00,301 --> 00:23:02,436
During my research, I came
across this sanitarium

356
00:23:02,437 --> 00:23:04,705
that was right near the
property I'm investigating.

357
00:23:04,706 --> 00:23:06,622
What can you tell me about this place?

358
00:23:06,623 --> 00:23:11,536
Well, Steve, we had a place here that was
called the Neutral Water Health Spa.

359
00:23:11,537 --> 00:23:17,437
That was centered on the healing
waters of the creek behind us.

360
00:23:17,851 --> 00:23:20,742
It was cedar water that
comes up from the ground.

361
00:23:20,743 --> 00:23:23,423
It was advertised in several publications,

362
00:23:23,424 --> 00:23:26,159
and people that had all kinds
of ailments would come here,

363
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,780
and walk in the health waters.

364
00:23:29,781 --> 00:23:33,266
They heard that all the
wonderful cures you can get.

365
00:23:33,267 --> 00:23:37,493
What kind of ailments did these people
have that they would go in the water?

366
00:23:37,494 --> 00:23:42,968
Prostate problems, kidney problems,
uterine problems, infertility.

367
00:23:42,969 --> 00:23:46,058
- Okay.
- You name it, they came here for it.

368
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:48,256
So there were a lot of sick
people on these grounds?

369
00:23:48,257 --> 00:23:52,020
- Yes, basically.
- Do we know if anybody died in this place?

370
00:23:52,021 --> 00:23:54,697
Well, we do have a reference
to one person who came here

371
00:23:54,698 --> 00:23:57,707
that the doctors in the area thought
he was at death's doorstep.

372
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:00,368
And thought he shouldn't be
accepted, but they took him in.

373
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:04,869
But we have no reference of how he died.

374
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:07,356
Whoa.

375
00:24:07,357 --> 00:24:13,117
So there's a lot of people
that are walking through here.

376
00:24:16,094 --> 00:24:20,054
Woo. Lots of illness here. [Bleep]

377
00:24:21,265 --> 00:24:25,225
A lot of people who are vomiting.

378
00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:28,195
Something with preservation, maybe.

379
00:24:28,196 --> 00:24:32,166
Somebody's dying that has
something to do with this...

380
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:33,689
Group.

381
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:37,519
I feel really sick out here. I
feel really out of it out here.

382
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,480
I feel, like, lightheaded, dizzy...

383
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,959
Hot, dehydrated, chest pain.

384
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,200
I can't see very well.

385
00:24:55,156 --> 00:24:57,460
Who ran this place? I mean,
was it a state place?

386
00:24:57,461 --> 00:25:01,345
No, it was a private entity that was
incorporated here in Egg Harbor City.

387
00:25:01,346 --> 00:25:04,168
And it was run by a Dr. Charles Smith.

388
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,919
What kind of guy was he?

389
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,626
He was a very charismatic
person, eccentric.

390
00:25:08,627 --> 00:25:11,804
He wholeheartedly believed
in his "fountain of youth".

391
00:25:11,805 --> 00:25:13,893
Was he a legit doctor?
Did he have a degree?

392
00:25:13,894 --> 00:25:15,063
No he didn't have a degree,

393
00:25:15,064 --> 00:25:18,555
and there's nothing on record with
The State Department of Health.

394
00:25:18,556 --> 00:25:21,741
He once said that he was born in 1776,

395
00:25:21,742 --> 00:25:26,539
which would have made him well
over 140 years old when he died.

396
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,088
Any given time, the
Neutral Water Health Spa,

397
00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:32,951
was pretty loaded with
about 100-and-some people.

398
00:25:32,952 --> 00:25:35,811
So he made a good living doing this.

399
00:25:35,812 --> 00:25:37,229
Basically, yeah.

400
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,967
He was quite well-to-do at the end

401
00:25:39,968 --> 00:25:43,602
because just to build this
facility and this house

402
00:25:43,603 --> 00:25:49,423
and everything else that he had
took quite a bit of money.

403
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,886
There is a structure.

404
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:56,856
I'm getting, like, the people
who had to organize it.

405
00:25:56,857 --> 00:25:59,977
Maybe doctors, maybe...

406
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:04,119
People that had to put this together.

407
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,978
And there's a dead person here.
I don't like him.

408
00:26:08,979 --> 00:26:12,271
And there's a lot of money around him.

409
00:26:12,272 --> 00:26:16,112
He's very, very sick physically.

410
00:26:16,506 --> 00:26:20,106
And mentally, he's disturbed.

411
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:31,931
During my walk, I
encountered many entities,

412
00:26:31,932 --> 00:26:36,989
so I had a sketch artist draw
the two who stood out clearly.

413
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,596
First, the old man in the house.

414
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:44,937
He's probably about 80, very
sick, very, very frail.

415
00:26:45,212 --> 00:26:47,660
How would you describe
the shape of the head?

416
00:26:47,661 --> 00:26:51,924
Fairly round, but then it
does kind of come down...

417
00:26:51,925 --> 00:26:54,865
To a sharper point.

418
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:59,978
Next, I describe the bizarre
creatures in the Master Bedroom.

419
00:26:59,979 --> 00:27:02,663
These little things...

420
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:06,348
That kind of resemble a jellyfish.

421
00:27:06,349 --> 00:27:12,249
This is kind of flipped, and then
the tentacles are coming out.

422
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,821
Amy, is this what you saw?

423
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:20,624
Yes.

424
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,694
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

425
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:48,499
we're going to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

426
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,824
This is Fred and Jessee.

427
00:27:49,825 --> 00:27:51,258
- Hi.
- Hi. Hello.

428
00:27:51,259 --> 00:27:55,640
They're married. They've been living in
this house a little bit over eight years.

429
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:58,949
They've been having experiences
ever since they moved in.

430
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:03,017
But lately, things have
gotten really out of hand.

431
00:28:03,018 --> 00:28:05,283
What's most disturbing is they
got three small children,

432
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:09,277
and two of them are starting
to have experiences.

433
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:11,189
That being said, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy,

434
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:16,590
and she can explain what she
encountered on her walk.

435
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:25,300
The first thing that I got was I was
actually pulled to the backyard.

436
00:28:25,301 --> 00:28:30,581
I saw a lot of people there
and a lot of illness.

437
00:28:30,693 --> 00:28:33,632
These individuals were involved with...

438
00:28:33,633 --> 00:28:37,173
Trying to preserve something.

439
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:41,895
And I saw the people who were trying
to organize this were doctors,

440
00:28:41,896 --> 00:28:44,370
but they couldn't make it work.

441
00:28:44,371 --> 00:28:48,973
Then I saw this one man
standing out, and he...

442
00:28:48,974 --> 00:28:52,334
Was severely mentally ill.

443
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:59,217
Well, there was this sanitarium
less than a mile from here.

444
00:28:59,218 --> 00:29:03,478
This is the picture of the sanitarium.

445
00:29:03,739 --> 00:29:06,121
This is in the late 1800s.

446
00:29:06,122 --> 00:29:10,993
This guy, Dr. Smith, claimed that he
discovered the fountain of youth.

447
00:29:10,994 --> 00:29:13,996
At any given time, he had over
100 people in this place.

448
00:29:13,997 --> 00:29:16,736
These people were sick that went there.

449
00:29:16,737 --> 00:29:19,267
What they were trying to
preserve was their youth.

450
00:29:19,268 --> 00:29:22,824
- Was he a real doctor?
- No, but you said he was crazy.

451
00:29:22,825 --> 00:29:26,702
He told somebody during a census
that he was 147 years old.

452
00:29:26,703 --> 00:29:32,103
I mean, do you think this
is what you picked up on?

453
00:29:32,248 --> 00:29:34,108
Yes.

454
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,019
What else did you see?

455
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:40,654
When I walked in the house, I felt like...

456
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:44,846
The illnesses were a little
bit in the living room.

457
00:29:44,847 --> 00:29:48,488
Then when I went in the
pink room, I felt it...

458
00:29:48,489 --> 00:29:51,129
Really strongly.

459
00:29:52,211 --> 00:29:57,131
And I feel like it's
coming from the outside.

460
00:29:58,555 --> 00:30:00,803
That's my daughter's room.

461
00:30:00,804 --> 00:30:04,884
She's been sick for two years now.

462
00:30:05,461 --> 00:30:07,669
And they just couldn't find
anything wrong with her.

463
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:12,713
They tested her from everything from cancer
to, like, anything that you can think of.

464
00:30:12,714 --> 00:30:15,772
And then six, eight months ago,
she got her appendix taken out.

465
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:17,013
Oh, my gosh.

466
00:30:17,014 --> 00:30:19,844
We actually had a nurse that
was a nurse for 20 years,

467
00:30:19,845 --> 00:30:24,355
say that she's never seen a 3-year-old
get her appendix taken out.

468
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:26,996
It's not fair.

469
00:30:29,348 --> 00:30:31,320
What else did you see?

470
00:30:31,321 --> 00:30:35,758
I saw an old man in the house.
And he's in his death state.

471
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:39,971
He's just, like, confused, and
he's about 80, really little guy.

472
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:45,552
His favorite spot is in the
closet in the back bedroom.

473
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,825
He hides in there.

474
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,167
Wow.

475
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:58,411
That's my son's room.

476
00:30:58,412 --> 00:31:02,869
He's 6. He's never slept
a full night in his bed.

477
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:07,130
It validates everything he says to me.

478
00:31:07,221 --> 00:31:09,758
Well, there was a guy that
lived here for 51 years.

479
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:13,675
His name was Louis Brunk.
He died at the age of 87.

480
00:31:13,676 --> 00:31:16,407
I actually spoke to his
daughter, who grew up here.

481
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:21,042
At the end, he psychologically wasn't
right, and he would talk to his daughter

482
00:31:21,043 --> 00:31:24,720
and say, there's people here, they're
bothering me, they're talking to me.

483
00:31:24,721 --> 00:31:26,873
This is the guy.

484
00:31:26,874 --> 00:31:32,514
And actually, that's his
daughter in the photo with him.

485
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:40,417
I did a sketch of a man I think
you're going to want to see.

486
00:31:44,912 --> 00:31:47,732
You guys tell me.

487
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,870
Wow.

488
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:01,779
That's crazy.

489
00:32:02,385 --> 00:32:04,130
I think it's him.

490
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:07,666
I think it's too close to
dismiss it to be anyone else.

491
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:09,947
It's him.

492
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,939
When I got here, behind me...

493
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:21,911
Was what I initially thought
was a shadow person...

494
00:32:21,912 --> 00:32:24,083
Huge, though. Huge.

495
00:32:24,084 --> 00:32:27,554
And then I realized, as he
was walking up behind me,

496
00:32:27,555 --> 00:32:30,522
that it was just a male who was hiding.

497
00:32:30,523 --> 00:32:34,954
His two favorite places are
the basement and the garage.

498
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:38,763
This guy is very capable
of inflicting pain.

499
00:32:38,764 --> 00:32:41,829
He was very threatened by me being here.

500
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:45,238
Like, right away, we're out here, and
he comes in, and he's flipping out.

501
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:48,848
He's, like, pounding on me.
He's like, get the [Bleep] out.

502
00:32:48,849 --> 00:32:50,964
Get out of here. Get out of here.

503
00:32:50,965 --> 00:32:54,954
His goal is to try to screw up...

504
00:32:54,955 --> 00:32:57,295
Your lives.

505
00:32:57,744 --> 00:33:02,530
Now, Jessee had an experience with a
shadow thing down in the basement.

506
00:33:02,531 --> 00:33:04,791
- Right.
- Would you explain that to Amy?

507
00:33:04,792 --> 00:33:07,259
I was walking down the steps with my son.

508
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,126
I get to the bottom step and I turn to him

509
00:33:10,127 --> 00:33:12,971
and right in front of
the light, very slowly,

510
00:33:12,972 --> 00:33:17,603
this large, like, floor-to-ceiling black
mass walked in front of the light.

511
00:33:17,604 --> 00:33:21,252
And it stopped for a good
three to four seconds.

512
00:33:21,253 --> 00:33:24,638
And then it, like, just dissipated.

513
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:27,613
Coming up on the porch one
time, there was a shadow.

514
00:33:27,614 --> 00:33:29,315
It looked at me. I looked at him.

515
00:33:29,316 --> 00:33:31,666
And the other time, I mean,
I was sitting on the couch,

516
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:34,110
and she was putting the kids to bed.

517
00:33:34,111 --> 00:33:36,127
Same thing.

518
00:33:36,128 --> 00:33:39,424
The back story that I
was able to get on him.

519
00:33:39,425 --> 00:33:43,347
Was that he's from like 100, 200 years ago.

520
00:33:43,348 --> 00:33:47,906
He was from another country, and he felt...

521
00:33:47,907 --> 00:33:51,070
Like he had been double-crossed.

522
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:53,704
Something to do with land and money.

523
00:33:53,705 --> 00:33:57,545
And he became extremely vengeful.

524
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,412
Amy, let me tell you about
this guy Louis Roesch.

525
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,815
He came here from Germany
back in the 1860s.

526
00:34:02,816 --> 00:34:04,775
Came here with his wife and his brother.

527
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:08,687
They settled in Egg Harbor, right under
the land that your house sits on.

528
00:34:08,688 --> 00:34:14,193
Supposedly, this place was gonna have
schools, churches, theaters, hospitals.

529
00:34:14,194 --> 00:34:17,296
They buy it, they come here,
they look at their land...

530
00:34:17,297 --> 00:34:20,432
There's none of that. All they
got are trees and mosquitoes.

531
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:25,204
Basically, he was betrayed by the
people he gave his money to.

532
00:34:25,205 --> 00:34:29,487
He also had a lot of tragedy. Out of
his six kids, three of them died.

533
00:34:29,488 --> 00:34:35,248
The youngest was a little girl.
She died from appendicitis.

534
00:34:35,386 --> 00:34:39,375
He had a 9-year-old they
said died from a cold.

535
00:34:39,376 --> 00:34:43,065
He had a 26-year-old son
that died from enteritis.

536
00:34:43,066 --> 00:34:48,966
Had they been in a developed area, these
kids probably wouldn't have died.

537
00:34:50,217 --> 00:34:53,832
The next thing that I encountered was
when I went into the Master Bedroom.

538
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:59,533
And what I saw in there was
these things on the ceiling.

539
00:35:00,207 --> 00:35:02,851
And they had, like, little tentacles.

540
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:07,472
And they become very, very active at night.

541
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,736
One of the main things... they don't sleep.

542
00:35:10,737 --> 00:35:12,484
- Ever.
- Ever.

543
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:15,905
- For eight years?
- Yeah.

544
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,057
You had a sleepwalking incident.

545
00:35:18,058 --> 00:35:19,702
- I did.
- Really?

546
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:23,055
Three months after we first
moved into the house.

547
00:35:23,056 --> 00:35:27,243
In my dream, I had woken up, and there
was a kid standing in my closet.

548
00:35:27,244 --> 00:35:30,187
I followed him out, and he
stopped at the basement door.

549
00:35:30,188 --> 00:35:33,072
He walked down the steps,
stopped at the landing.

550
00:35:33,073 --> 00:35:35,503
I stopped on the landing, and I woke up.

551
00:35:35,504 --> 00:35:38,613
And when I woke up, I was
standing on the landing.

552
00:35:38,614 --> 00:35:41,332
And then I called Fred, hysterical.

553
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:43,029
Something's got to give.

554
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:46,514
Amy, do you know what those
things on the ceilings are?

555
00:35:46,515 --> 00:35:50,770
They're shattered aspects of the
people who lived and died here.

556
00:35:50,771 --> 00:35:53,157
It's kind of hard to visualize
what I'm talking about,

557
00:35:53,158 --> 00:35:57,118
so the sketch artist did draw it.

558
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:06,080
That's interesting. Take a look at that.

559
00:36:09,112 --> 00:36:11,512
Oh, my God.

560
00:36:28,325 --> 00:36:31,101
Do you know what those
things on the ceilings are?

561
00:36:31,102 --> 00:36:35,373
They're shattered aspects of the
people who lived and died here.

562
00:36:35,374 --> 00:36:37,596
It's kind of hard to visualize
what I'm talking about,

563
00:36:37,597 --> 00:36:41,557
so the sketch artist did draw it.

564
00:36:46,252 --> 00:36:50,692
That's interesting. Take a look at that.

565
00:36:53,866 --> 00:36:56,266
Oh, my God.

566
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:05,890
Does it remind you of a dream you had?

567
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:08,059
That's exactly where it was. Right there.

568
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,561
Identical. That whole shape.

569
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:14,455
Absolutely. To the "T".
That's how I felt afterwards.

570
00:37:14,456 --> 00:37:16,834
Exact placement.

571
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:19,709
What's going on is that...

572
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:24,030
This guy Louis wants these things to...

573
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:31,226
Become an entity so he can
do very, very bad things.

574
00:37:31,467 --> 00:37:34,384
This Louis or the one from Germany?

575
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:38,188
The one from Germany... the bad Louis.

576
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:41,008
Honestly, I don't even
know what to do with this.

577
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:44,129
His goal is vengeance.

578
00:37:44,335 --> 00:37:46,760
Because he felt double-crossed.

579
00:37:46,761 --> 00:37:51,921
And what he did was he
actually cursed this land.

580
00:37:52,306 --> 00:37:57,395
But when he did this curse,
he actually cursed himself.

581
00:37:57,396 --> 00:38:00,959
So he's, like, in this forever.
He can't get out.

582
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,407
But since he can't get out,
he's gonna continue to do this,

583
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:09,313
to create problems or illness or
misery or whatever he can do.

584
00:38:09,314 --> 00:38:12,056
Your sleepwalking incident...

585
00:38:12,057 --> 00:38:16,557
Probably him, probably trying to kill you.

586
00:38:18,414 --> 00:38:20,665
Is that why he's always checking up on me?

587
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:23,906
He's threatened by you.

588
00:38:24,126 --> 00:38:28,147
If he's able to ever get these things...

589
00:38:28,148 --> 00:38:29,984
Together.

590
00:38:29,985 --> 00:38:32,873
- What could happen?
- He'd get more powerful.

591
00:38:32,874 --> 00:38:38,774
He would be able to control them
and also feed off of their energy.

592
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:41,518
- Was there anything else?
- No.

593
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:46,799
Well, remember before, I
told you about Louis Brunk?

594
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:50,994
His 14-year-old son hung
himself in the basement here.

595
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,915
Okay.

596
00:38:54,894 --> 00:38:59,214
Nobody knows why. Talked to his sister.

597
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:02,801
Why do you think you think you
didn't get the hanging downstairs?

598
00:39:02,802 --> 00:39:04,719
It could be several things.

599
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,278
He could just be gone, or
he could be scattered.

600
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,643
- Do you have a picture?
- Of him?

601
00:39:10,644 --> 00:39:13,824
- Of the son.
- I do.

602
00:39:16,088 --> 00:39:18,488
Oh, my God.

603
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:24,572
That's who I saw in my dream.

604
00:39:32,477 --> 00:39:35,206
I don't think his son was a bad person,

605
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:38,646
so I don't think he would lead
you down a flight of stairs.

606
00:39:38,647 --> 00:39:42,096
It could be that he was
influenced by this guy, Louis.

607
00:39:42,097 --> 00:39:44,977
Which is not good.

608
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:53,502
Jessee, Fred, you got hit with
a lot of information tonight.

609
00:39:53,503 --> 00:39:56,653
And I'm sure some of it's not
what you wanted to hear.

610
00:39:56,654 --> 00:40:01,404
The pressing question is, is it safe for
you to raise your children in this house?

611
00:40:01,405 --> 00:40:03,467
For that question, I'm gonna
turn that over to Amy,

612
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:08,268
and hopefully she'll
have an answer for you.

613
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:16,260
You have a lot of dead
around this location, but...

614
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:21,515
It's really beneficial for you
and the dead that are here...

615
00:40:21,516 --> 00:40:24,805
If you stay and stop the vicious cycle.

616
00:40:24,806 --> 00:40:29,486
What I feel needs to be done here is to...

617
00:40:29,973 --> 00:40:33,153
Contact a local Wiccan.

618
00:40:33,154 --> 00:40:34,832
What exactly is a Wiccan?

619
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:37,742
Wiccans are, like, a natural witch.

620
00:40:37,743 --> 00:40:40,286
They are all about the Earth,
they are all about nature,

621
00:40:40,287 --> 00:40:45,414
they're all about preservation,
and she or he is going to...

622
00:40:45,415 --> 00:40:51,172
Do some kind of ritual that will negate the
curse that he has placed upon himself.

623
00:40:51,173 --> 00:40:55,853
Will the Wiccan take care of the bad Louis?

624
00:40:56,067 --> 00:41:00,402
Uh, this fractured stuff, and possibly...

625
00:41:00,403 --> 00:41:03,452
- Our poor guy here?
- Yes.

626
00:41:03,453 --> 00:41:07,460
And it'll protect them from his...

627
00:41:07,461 --> 00:41:09,345
Vengeful curse.

628
00:41:09,346 --> 00:41:12,903
Will that take care of this sickness
that's outside trying to get in?

629
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:15,652
Yes, yes. Mm-hmm.

630
00:41:15,653 --> 00:41:18,837
I would love to help him to be with him.

631
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:22,313
And even this guy... I would
like him to go with his family.

632
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:27,307
Just let us go and just
do what we have to do.

633
00:41:27,308 --> 00:41:29,290
Are you gonna take her advice?

634
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:31,301
- I'm gonna call tomorrow.
- Okay.

635
00:41:31,302 --> 00:41:35,025
What I had to go through, in
myself, which nobody knows...

636
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:40,926
Other than her, maybe my parents, is
what my daughter's sickness did to me.

637
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:43,133
I need to do it for her.

638
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:48,594
It's gonna be taken care
of by the end of the week.

639
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,054
I'm worried that if they don't
deal with it immediately,

640
00:41:55,055 --> 00:42:00,230
their suffering could continue, and they
might never find peace in their home.
