1
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:09,038
Tonight on Dead Files Revisited...

2
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:11,674
Unhealthy attachment to the dead.

3
00:00:11,675 --> 00:00:16,513
A second look at some of Amy and
Steve's most terrifying cases.

4
00:00:16,514 --> 00:00:18,023
He shoots him in the head.

5
00:00:18,024 --> 00:00:19,315
New information...

6
00:00:19,316 --> 00:00:21,584
I didn't know where else to turn.

7
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:23,190
Startling revelations.

8
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:25,955
I really wanted to see
what Amy was made of.

9
00:00:25,956 --> 00:00:29,983
First, a return to
Rock Island, Illinois...

10
00:00:29,984 --> 00:00:32,995
And there's people under the trees.

11
00:00:32,996 --> 00:00:35,007
Where an army of dead...

12
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:37,458
I feel like I'm always being watched.

13
00:00:37,459 --> 00:00:39,274
Invade a family home.

14
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:41,671
You scared to be at home?

15
00:00:41,672 --> 00:00:42,759
Then...

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,072
So, he's dead.

17
00:00:44,073 --> 00:00:46,282
We travel back to Key West, Florida...

18
00:00:46,283 --> 00:00:48,645
I don't have an explanation for it.

19
00:00:48,646 --> 00:00:51,147
To a house where lost souls...

20
00:00:51,148 --> 00:00:54,116
He was tortured and burnt.

21
00:00:54,117 --> 00:00:55,733
Torment the clients.

22
00:00:55,734 --> 00:00:58,165
Why are these people still
staying in this house?

23
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,656
Did they listen to Amy...

24
00:00:59,657 --> 00:01:01,694
Are you gonna follow Amy's advice?

25
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:03,955
Or continue to live in fear?

26
00:01:03,956 --> 00:01:08,336
All bad dead and bad guides must leave.

27
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,021
They're being watched.

28
00:01:12,022 --> 00:01:15,021
My name is Amy Allan.

29
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:17,517
This thing likes death.

30
00:01:17,518 --> 00:01:18,945
I see dead people.

31
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:20,580
This thing's, like, a monster.

32
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,615
I speak to dead people.

33
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,495
And he's pissed off now.

34
00:01:24,496 --> 00:01:25,766
And they speak to me.

35
00:01:25,767 --> 00:01:27,344
His head was cracked.

36
00:01:27,345 --> 00:01:30,931
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

37
00:01:30,932 --> 00:01:32,481
This guy was murdered.

38
00:01:32,482 --> 00:01:33,998
I rely on my partner.

39
00:01:33,999 --> 00:01:37,152
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

40
00:01:37,153 --> 00:01:39,866
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

41
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:43,120
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

42
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:44,637
You saw her?

43
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:45,872
It's my job to reveal them.

44
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:47,153
Why would you stay here?

45
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:49,191
But Steve and I never speak...

46
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,310
We never communicate
during an investigation.

47
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,679
Until the very end.

48
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,514
Stop it.

49
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,383
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

50
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:58,985
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

51
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:00,286
Or time to get out.

52
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:05,027
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

53
00:02:15,576 --> 00:02:18,712
I'll never forget the case
in Rock Island, Illinois.

54
00:02:18,713 --> 00:02:21,481
For our client, Mellissa,
life was a living hell.

55
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:23,857
Paranormal activity
had taken over her home.

56
00:02:23,858 --> 00:02:27,430
And her daughter, Madison,
couldn't handle it.

57
00:02:27,431 --> 00:02:30,176
And when our investigation exposed
that they weren't the only ones in

58
00:02:30,177 --> 00:02:34,294
the family suffering I'd wondered
if they'd ever be the same again.

59
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:37,002
So, Mellissa, I understand
that you and your 4 year

60
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:38,832
old daughter are having
problems in the house.

61
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,622
- Yes.
- Okay. Who else lives here?

62
00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:45,238
My husband, Mike, and our
7 year old son, Nathan.

63
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,760
We're seeing apparitions, shadows.

64
00:02:48,761 --> 00:02:52,806
Our daughter, Madison... we
want her to not be afraid.

65
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:56,116
We want her to have a normal childhood.

66
00:02:56,117 --> 00:03:00,520
At first, I thought it was just
typical, kids having imaginary friends.

67
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:03,922
But then it became apparent that it
wasn't an imaginary friends of hers.

68
00:03:03,923 --> 00:03:05,731
She was terrified.

69
00:03:05,732 --> 00:03:08,018
I was like, okay, I
need to protect my kids.

70
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:11,278
So I need to do something about this.

71
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:17,179
She wakes up in the middle of the night,
crying, just blood-curdling screams.

72
00:03:17,982 --> 00:03:20,165
I don't like being in here by myself.

73
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:26,066
So I don't really blame her for not
wanting to be in here by herself at night.

74
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:37,124
On the drive to the location, I
sensed an evil presence waiting for me.

75
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:40,080
But when I came face-to-face
with him for the first time,

76
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:45,044
I knew the only way to make it through
this walk was to keep my guard up.

77
00:03:45,045 --> 00:03:49,305
There's, like, people under the trees.

78
00:03:53,174 --> 00:03:57,210
There's also this other
really creepy dude.

79
00:03:57,211 --> 00:03:59,855
He wears a cloak.

80
00:03:59,856 --> 00:04:02,470
He works with these people
in the trees, though.

81
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:06,431
They're, like, underlings for him.

82
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,110
The cloaked man had amassed a
seemingly endless army of the dead,

83
00:04:10,111 --> 00:04:13,355
and his plan for them was clear.

84
00:04:13,356 --> 00:04:17,616
He wants to get rid of living people.

85
00:04:18,532 --> 00:04:19,830
So, what's going on in here?

86
00:04:19,831 --> 00:04:22,468
I feel like I'm being watched down here.

87
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:26,604
And it's like when I go up the
stairs to go back upstairs...

88
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:29,056
It's almost like if you were
being chased up the stairs,

89
00:04:29,057 --> 00:04:31,782
how you want to hurry
up and get to the top.

90
00:04:31,783 --> 00:04:34,400
That's how I feel.

91
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:37,475
I've had these experiences
most of my life,

92
00:04:37,476 --> 00:04:40,053
and I was never really afraid of it.

93
00:04:40,054 --> 00:04:44,348
But that feeling of something
standing there, just watching me.

94
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:47,126
It gave me the chills.

95
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:50,363
Now, when did things
kind of pick up here?

96
00:04:50,364 --> 00:04:55,401
When we moved in, I was pregnant with
my son Noah, and Nathan was about 2.

97
00:04:55,402 --> 00:04:57,881
And I noticed...

98
00:04:57,882 --> 00:04:59,303
Um...

99
00:04:59,304 --> 00:05:01,007
A shadow in the basement.

100
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:03,299
Okay, so, your son Noah.
You didn't mention Noah.

101
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,940
Yeah, I was pregnant with
Noah when we bought the house.

102
00:05:09,217 --> 00:05:13,353
He passed pretty much right
away after he was born.

103
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:16,954
I'm sorry to hear that.

104
00:05:20,728 --> 00:05:24,186
There's two people here who are mediums.

105
00:05:24,187 --> 00:05:27,648
One of them is extremely developed.

106
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:30,709
It might be a child.

107
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:39,401
This living person is
very attracted to death.

108
00:05:39,808 --> 00:05:45,708
I think there's family members
that this person's held onto.

109
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:49,549
Unhealthy attachment to the dead.

110
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:54,076
For someone with abilities,
emotions are a really powerful tool.

111
00:05:54,077 --> 00:05:59,699
But if they're not in control of those
emotions, the impact can be serious.

112
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,741
Yeah, and stuff happens in here...

113
00:06:02,742 --> 00:06:04,577
Poltergeist **** you know?

114
00:06:04,578 --> 00:06:06,689
Do you have any idea
who it's coming from?

115
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,132
- I want to say a female.
- Okay.

116
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:13,280
The living person doesn't know how to
release their **** emotions properly.

117
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:15,181
Anything that could be dangerous?

118
00:06:15,182 --> 00:06:17,042
Yes.

119
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:23,290
Mellissa's focus was primarily
on herself and her daughter.

120
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:26,592
But her husband, Mike, pointed
me in a different direction.

121
00:06:26,593 --> 00:06:27,881
What about your son?

122
00:06:27,882 --> 00:06:29,764
He's never really
complained of anything before

123
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,552
except for not wanting
to go in the basement.

124
00:06:31,553 --> 00:06:33,145
I don't know if that was
because of anything that

125
00:06:33,146 --> 00:06:34,652
was happening that he
didn't want to talk about.

126
00:06:34,653 --> 00:06:36,392
- If he's seeing something.
- Right, right.

127
00:06:36,393 --> 00:06:38,076
I don't know how to fix that.

128
00:06:38,077 --> 00:06:40,456
So, I decided to talk to the other child

129
00:06:40,457 --> 00:06:45,557
and find out what he
wasn't telling his parents.

130
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:52,959
So, Nathan, I was talking
to mom and she told me that

131
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,172
you've been experiencing
some stuff in the house here?

132
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:57,640
Have you had any experiences?

133
00:06:57,641 --> 00:06:58,873
Explain that to me.

134
00:06:58,874 --> 00:07:01,311
I was in my bed, looking at the closet.

135
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:05,121
I saw, like, a gray
shadow running across it.

136
00:07:05,122 --> 00:07:07,450
It was kind of a person shadow.

137
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:09,119
All right. So, did that scare you?

138
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,553
It scared me a lot.

139
00:07:10,554 --> 00:07:14,838
Just tried not to think
of it and have a nightmare.

140
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:17,259
Okay. Did you tell anybody about it?

141
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,729
No, I haven't yet.

142
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,611
It was nice to share my
information with Steve.

143
00:07:23,612 --> 00:07:27,237
Because I got to tell
him about what I saw.

144
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,927
It was the first time I've
ever told someone because,

145
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:34,528
I was scared to tell my mom and dad.

146
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:36,579
So, anything else happen?

147
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,546
I felt someone trying
to pull me downstairs.

148
00:07:39,547 --> 00:07:41,384
Down in the basement?

149
00:07:41,385 --> 00:07:42,893
How?

150
00:07:42,894 --> 00:07:46,256
Like, grabbing onto my shirt.

151
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,306
When I heard that Nathan was feeling

152
00:07:49,307 --> 00:07:51,938
and hearing and seeing
the same things I was.

153
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:56,299
I was completely shocked, because he
had never said anything to me before.

154
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,903
Are you scared to be at home?

155
00:07:58,904 --> 00:08:00,764
Yes.

156
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:06,469
The ones that are coming in
here, they can get kind of nasty.

157
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:12,215
They more look like shadows, but
they, like, are up against the walls.

158
00:08:12,216 --> 00:08:15,294
Is there anything else these
people can do to the living?

159
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:21,124
You see them out of the corner
of your eye, but you feel them.

160
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,920
What will these things eventually do?

161
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:26,329
Well, they can kill.

162
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,394
Next...

163
00:08:27,395 --> 00:08:28,912
He's burying bodies.

164
00:08:28,913 --> 00:08:31,368
A betrayal ends in tragedy.

165
00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:32,869
They lost everything.

166
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,038
And in our second investigation...

167
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,507
I know it's a dead person.

168
00:08:37,508 --> 00:08:39,142
The fate of the dead...

169
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,672
Get out, get out, get out of my house!

170
00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:44,264
Rests in the hands of the living.

171
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:46,425
Get out!

172
00:08:56,114 --> 00:08:58,340
Our clients in Rock
Island mentioned that

173
00:08:58,341 --> 00:09:00,925
their land used to be owned
by a notorious gangster.

174
00:09:00,926 --> 00:09:04,688
Whenever the mob's involved, it's a
safe bet that something shady went down.

175
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:10,589
But after talking to a local author,
it was worse than I had expected.

176
00:09:16,101 --> 00:09:17,834
This is John Looney.

177
00:09:17,835 --> 00:09:20,371
He met a woman named Nora O'Connor.

178
00:09:20,372 --> 00:09:24,807
They got married, and they
had two daughters and a son.

179
00:09:24,808 --> 00:09:25,573
Okay.

180
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:28,299
But about 1903, his wife dies.

181
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,998
And he spiraled downward
into this life of crime.

182
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:37,662
He was involved in gambling,
moonshine, prostitution.

183
00:09:37,663 --> 00:09:42,359
This is Looney from sort
of the height of his power.

184
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,661
How powerful did this guy get?

185
00:09:44,662 --> 00:09:47,535
Well, he basically controlled the town.

186
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:50,085
People were very afraid of him.

187
00:09:50,086 --> 00:09:52,136
Okay. Now, I assume
he was a violent man.

188
00:09:52,137 --> 00:09:54,871
Well, we know that a lot
of people died, and...

189
00:09:54,872 --> 00:10:00,772
Looney had people on his payroll who
were, you know, basically paid hit men.

190
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:06,062
There's, like, a family out there...

191
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:11,963
You know, like, a mother, a father,
I think like two or three kids.

192
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:17,911
But their father...
he's kind of freaky...

193
00:10:18,096 --> 00:10:21,056
Kind of creepy-looking, too...

194
00:10:21,057 --> 00:10:23,482
Dressed all in black.

195
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:26,873
I'm getting something about...

196
00:10:26,874 --> 00:10:28,939
Dirty dealings.

197
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,478
At first, the man in black was giving
off an eerie vibe and not much else.

198
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:39,379
But that feeling quickly changed as soon
as he revealed his crueler, darker side.

199
00:10:40,512 --> 00:10:44,277
I just got a nasty headache.

200
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:48,272
And someone's yelling about a gunshot.

201
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:51,495
I do feel like there's
a hole in my head.

202
00:10:51,496 --> 00:10:53,536
****

203
00:10:56,434 --> 00:10:59,877
There's, like, blood and then confusion.

204
00:10:59,878 --> 00:11:02,739
Like, I don't know if they lived.

205
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,461
Do we know if he ever buried
any bodies on the property?

206
00:11:05,462 --> 00:11:09,927
He had, you know, this large piece
of land with nobody living around it.

207
00:11:09,928 --> 00:11:13,108
The opportunity existed.

208
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,176
He's, like, burying bodies.

209
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,867
I keep seeing these
bodies all over the place.

210
00:11:20,868 --> 00:11:26,230
He's, like, digging them and just
throwing them in the ground, you know?

211
00:11:26,231 --> 00:11:28,691
He was evil.

212
00:11:30,343 --> 00:11:35,203
He definitely was not
involved in good things.

213
00:11:36,935 --> 00:11:38,408
Continuing my research,

214
00:11:38,409 --> 00:11:42,412
I learned that Mellissa's property used
to belong to a Native American tribe.

215
00:11:42,413 --> 00:11:44,278
Before I got into this line of work,

216
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,409
I would have said that the
chance of connecting that

217
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,833
to the client's house
would have been slim.

218
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:52,016
But now that I've got a better
understanding of how Amy operates,

219
00:11:52,017 --> 00:11:56,757
I know that I've got
to follow every lead.

220
00:12:00,565 --> 00:12:06,096
Well, the last tribe of Indians to inhabit
that area were the Sauk Nation of Indians.

221
00:12:06,097 --> 00:12:08,539
And they were here from about 1735.

222
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,480
Okay, so, what happened
with the Indians there?

223
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:14,460
They lost their land to the
American government in 1804.

224
00:12:14,461 --> 00:12:19,216
But only about 1/3 of the tribe refused
to leave the land of their ancestors.

225
00:12:19,217 --> 00:12:23,953
But one of their spokesmen
was a man named Keokuk...

226
00:12:23,954 --> 00:12:27,557
Who was very friendly to the Americans.

227
00:12:27,558 --> 00:12:31,118
He was able to convince his own people,

228
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:33,631
that there was no point in
fighting the American government.

229
00:12:33,632 --> 00:12:35,278
And it to just move as they were told.

230
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,846
What about the people that didn't
support him, how did they feel?

231
00:12:37,847 --> 00:12:42,639
Well, they felt that he was a
coward, a traitor to their nation.

232
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,811
So, the people that sided with Keokuk,
did they prosper with the deal he made?

233
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:50,503
Well, no, they were
removed over into Iowa

234
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:53,763
and told that they
could live there forever.

235
00:12:53,764 --> 00:12:57,487
But within 10 years of
this promise, they're gone.

236
00:12:57,488 --> 00:13:02,288
- They lost everything?
- They lost everything.

237
00:13:03,294 --> 00:13:08,788
I'm seeing this leader guy
again, who's wearing a cloak.

238
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,779
And he says that
everybody who's come since

239
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:16,593
has just **** everything
up and destroyed it.

240
00:13:16,594 --> 00:13:21,032
He feels justified as far
as wreaking havoc on people.

241
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:24,817
As I watched the cloaked man
plan his attack on the home,

242
00:13:24,818 --> 00:13:29,119
I started to realize that he planned
to wipe out more than just the living.

243
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,154
What does he do?

244
00:13:31,155 --> 00:13:35,925
Basically whatever needs to be done,
but he sends his people in to do it.

245
00:13:35,926 --> 00:13:37,860
What do you mean?

246
00:13:37,861 --> 00:13:42,241
The people that he puts in the trees...

247
00:13:42,438 --> 00:13:46,698
Were from his time, like 17-something.

248
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:56,261
When he sends people into the
house, why is he doing that?

249
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:03,052
That's him trying to
get rid of this building.

250
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:04,053
Next...

251
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:06,022
That's pretty scary.

252
00:14:06,023 --> 00:14:08,590
Did the clients follow Amy's advice?

253
00:14:08,591 --> 00:14:10,996
I didn't know where else to turn.

254
00:14:10,997 --> 00:14:15,042
My spirit helpers, I'm
here to help these people.

255
00:14:15,043 --> 00:14:17,734
There are spirits here
who are hurting them.

256
00:14:17,735 --> 00:14:20,675
Please release them.

257
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,000
Mike and Mellissa have
been here about five years.

258
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:42,720
Mellissa's had experiences
from the minute they came here.

259
00:14:42,721 --> 00:14:44,034
Going into the reveal,

260
00:14:44,035 --> 00:14:46,836
we knew Amy was gonna be
able to give us some answers.

261
00:14:46,837 --> 00:14:50,135
But I never thought she'd
be able to answer so much.

262
00:14:50,136 --> 00:14:51,826
They have two beautiful children,

263
00:14:51,827 --> 00:14:56,842
so they're concerned if their kids
can live here in a safe environment.

264
00:14:56,843 --> 00:15:00,157
One of the first people that
I encountered was a male.

265
00:15:00,158 --> 00:15:03,074
I did get that while he was
alive, he was particularly evil,

266
00:15:03,075 --> 00:15:06,941
and he definitely was not
involved in anything good.

267
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:11,791
John Looney was a gangster that
owned this property back in the 1920s.

268
00:15:11,792 --> 00:15:13,459
He was supposedly very ruthless...

269
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,370
Got convicted of murder.

270
00:15:15,371 --> 00:15:17,753
He was suspected in
many, many more deaths.

271
00:15:17,754 --> 00:15:20,633
Looks like him, yeah.

272
00:15:20,634 --> 00:15:23,856
Knowing who this man was and his history

273
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:27,866
and the fact that he's in my
house made me very uncomfortable.

274
00:15:27,867 --> 00:15:30,643
It gave me the chills.

275
00:15:30,644 --> 00:15:32,545
What else did you see?

276
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:34,406
Well, then I saw something out back.

277
00:15:34,407 --> 00:15:37,450
Under the trees are all these people.

278
00:15:37,451 --> 00:15:41,406
And their leader was this man
who, he was wearing a dark cloak.

279
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:44,356
He just made a big mistake.

280
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:50,257
And now that he's dead, he does an
incredible job of watching his territories.

281
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:55,885
There was a tribe of Indians called the
Sauk Nation that inhabited your land.

282
00:15:55,886 --> 00:16:00,764
There was an Indian by the name of
Keokuk, and when the white men came...

283
00:16:00,765 --> 00:16:04,853
He basically sold out the whole Indian
nation here and had them displaced.

284
00:16:04,854 --> 00:16:09,894
What this person wants
is the house to be gone.

285
00:16:09,992 --> 00:16:13,587
He'll send other people to,
like, take care of business.

286
00:16:13,588 --> 00:16:17,860
What scared me the most was
Keokuk, because he's so powerful.

287
00:16:17,861 --> 00:16:22,277
If he's able to kind of trap
all these other people here,

288
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:25,012
who knows what he can
do to me or my family?

289
00:16:25,013 --> 00:16:27,228
Now, did you see any of those
people inside this house?

290
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:30,288
I went down to the basement,

291
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:36,189
I saw some of the specific dead people that
I think were sent to destroy your house.

292
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:39,025
I actually saw somebody
doing laundry, a female.

293
00:16:39,026 --> 00:16:44,022
This was a living person, and one
of them was crawling on the floor...

294
00:16:44,023 --> 00:16:48,020
And was actually trying to
grab the person's pant leg.

295
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:51,013
Yeah, there's something
about that laundry room.

296
00:16:51,014 --> 00:16:53,626
I feel like I'm always being watched.

297
00:16:53,627 --> 00:16:56,024
You said you saw a living
woman? That's what you saw?

298
00:16:56,025 --> 00:16:58,555
Well, I sketched it.

299
00:16:58,556 --> 00:17:00,956
She's gray.

300
00:17:02,848 --> 00:17:06,928
Her legs are kind of bent sideways.

301
00:17:08,274 --> 00:17:10,134
Wow.

302
00:17:14,157 --> 00:17:16,487
That's pretty scary.

303
00:17:16,488 --> 00:17:21,385
Once they pulled out the sketch and
I saw how scared it made my husband.

304
00:17:21,386 --> 00:17:25,751
It was like the people that are trapped
here are reaching out for my help.

305
00:17:25,752 --> 00:17:29,294
And I really wanted to
help these people move on.

306
00:17:29,295 --> 00:17:34,104
So I was hoping that Amy would be
able to give me the tools to do that.

307
00:17:34,105 --> 00:17:38,531
I did get that there was someone
here who brings in the dead.

308
00:17:38,532 --> 00:17:43,128
And the other thing was getting that there
was a child who's extremely open here.

309
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:47,980
And very well developed,
which is very interesting.

310
00:17:47,981 --> 00:17:53,576
When I went into their bedroom,
the dead lined up and greeted me.

311
00:17:53,577 --> 00:17:55,487
It had the bunk beds, I think.

312
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:56,855
That's Nathan's room.

313
00:17:56,856 --> 00:18:00,206
I think your daughter has
something going on too, but...

314
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:05,365
Right now, he is way more
advanced than your daughter.

315
00:18:05,366 --> 00:18:07,551
So, when Amy started talking about

316
00:18:07,552 --> 00:18:10,086
the child in the house
that was a sensitive.

317
00:18:10,087 --> 00:18:13,079
I immediately figured she
was talking about Madison.

318
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,309
Since she's the one that had been
having the experiences that I knew about.

319
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:21,179
I was just shocked that she
was talking about Nathan.

320
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:25,409
So, the last thing was a little
bit of poltergeist going on here.

321
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:30,012
I felt that the adult
medium won't let go.

322
00:18:30,013 --> 00:18:33,325
Specifically to the family and friends.

323
00:18:33,326 --> 00:18:34,437
That sound like you?

324
00:18:34,438 --> 00:18:38,158
We had another son named Noah.

325
00:18:38,342 --> 00:18:39,649
Okay.

326
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:44,630
And he actually passed
away shortly after birth.

327
00:18:47,306 --> 00:18:49,141
Sorry.

328
00:18:49,142 --> 00:18:51,482
It's okay.

329
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:57,882
I've had other people tell me that...

330
00:18:57,883 --> 00:19:00,524
I haven't grieved properly...

331
00:19:00,525 --> 00:19:02,865
For Noah...

332
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:08,839
The fact that Amy touched on something
so personal just blew my mind.

333
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,627
There's no way she could have known that

334
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:14,653
I had been struggling to deal with that.

335
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,770
And made me feel horrible that,

336
00:19:17,771 --> 00:19:22,572
I'm contributing to the chaos
that's going on in the house.

337
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:25,829
Well, Mellissa, I know
tonight was pretty rough.

338
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,913
But the big question is your children.

339
00:19:27,914 --> 00:19:33,074
- Right.
- Is it safe for them to be raised here?

340
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:36,188
So, the first thing you need
to do is grief counseling.

341
00:19:36,189 --> 00:19:38,526
This is going to allow
you to let go of the dead

342
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:42,431
and to process emotions
in a beneficial way.

343
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:45,199
For Nathan, every night
before he goes to bed,

344
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,324
have him state that he
only allows the good dead

345
00:19:48,325 --> 00:19:51,800
and guides to stand by him and help him.

346
00:19:51,801 --> 00:19:53,628
So, will that get Looney out of here?

347
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:55,489
Yes.

348
00:19:55,675 --> 00:19:59,708
So, the last thing is
you can go to the tribe...

349
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:05,609
That Keokuk is from and ask them
to do a ceremony in your backyard.

350
00:20:05,968 --> 00:20:10,255
To release him and the
people that he's imprisoned.

351
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:14,576
But are you gonna follow Amy's advice?

352
00:20:27,905 --> 00:20:32,274
When Amy told me everything I
had to do to fix the situation,

353
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:37,012
it was a lot of stuff to do, but I was
really anxious to get started on it.

354
00:20:37,013 --> 00:20:41,053
But we ran into some issues
getting Keokuk to leave.

355
00:20:41,054 --> 00:20:45,792
The Sauk tribe believes
that this is his land.

356
00:20:45,793 --> 00:20:49,361
He was here first. So they
weren't willing to help.

357
00:20:49,362 --> 00:20:53,382
I didn't know where else to turn.

358
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:58,569
My spirit helpers, I'm
here to help these people.

359
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:04,516
So, Amy told me that I
could contact a local Shaman,

360
00:21:04,517 --> 00:21:07,757
to help clear the land.

361
00:21:07,914 --> 00:21:10,816
There are spirits here
who are hurting them.

362
00:21:10,817 --> 00:21:12,885
Please release them.

363
00:21:12,886 --> 00:21:14,502
First, he went through the home

364
00:21:14,503 --> 00:21:18,056
and told the people that
are stuck here to move on.

365
00:21:18,057 --> 00:21:21,151
Please help make this house
a safer place for them.

366
00:21:21,152 --> 00:21:27,052
And then he went outside and was
doing a chant, asking Keokuk to leave.

367
00:21:31,117 --> 00:21:33,380
Help me. Work through me.

368
00:21:33,381 --> 00:21:35,825
So we may help these people,

369
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:39,679
rid themselves of this person
who is there and should not be.

370
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,314
Who has come to this house uninvited.

371
00:21:42,315 --> 00:21:44,316
I felt that this was it.

372
00:21:44,317 --> 00:21:50,217
We were gonna finally get rid of Keokuk,
and I was gonna actually get my home back.

373
00:21:51,925 --> 00:21:54,993
Help us to help this family
rid them of this unwanted guest.

374
00:21:54,994 --> 00:21:59,134
Please work through me to help them.

375
00:21:59,954 --> 00:22:02,820
Amy told me to enroll
in grief counseling,

376
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,803
and that's been helping me a lot.

377
00:22:04,804 --> 00:22:08,232
His name was Noah, and I had
him right before I had Madison,

378
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:10,555
and he only lived for a couple of hours.

379
00:22:10,556 --> 00:22:16,276
Nathan's doing his special prayer
every night to keep the evil away.

380
00:22:16,277 --> 00:22:20,542
I'll allow only the good dead and the
good guides to stand by and help me.

381
00:22:20,543 --> 00:22:23,779
All bad dead and bad guides must leave.

382
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,859
When I say the prayer, it
makes me feel really nice.

383
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,040
I feel protected, also.

384
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:38,737
While my kids aren't seeing
things anymore, I still am.

385
00:22:38,738 --> 00:22:42,802
I'm hoping that by continuing
the grief counseling...

386
00:22:42,803 --> 00:22:48,703
I am able to get to the point where
I don't see these ghosts anymore.

387
00:22:50,516 --> 00:22:54,565
While I understand Mellissa's concerns
about her future, I'm not worried.

388
00:22:54,566 --> 00:22:58,809
So far, she's managed to overcome
every challenge that's come her way.

389
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:04,710
And that determination will be the driving
force that keeps evil out of her home.

390
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:20,053
Early on in my time working with Amy,

391
00:23:20,054 --> 00:23:25,705
we investigated a home down in Key West,
Florida, that was swarming with activity.

392
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:29,918
Now, at this point, I was still coming to
grips on how this paranormal thing works.

393
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,819
But by the end, my eyes had
opened up just a little bit wider.

394
00:23:37,524 --> 00:23:40,473
Ever since I moved in,
I felt someone was here.

395
00:23:40,474 --> 00:23:42,409
I knew that I wasn't alone.

396
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:43,347
Okay.

397
00:23:43,348 --> 00:23:47,833
I feel cold spots everywhere,
but I don't see anything.

398
00:23:47,834 --> 00:23:49,802
I don't hear anything, really.

399
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:54,397
It just felt like someone else was in
the room, but you couldn't see them.

400
00:23:54,398 --> 00:23:57,649
I know it's a dead person.

401
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:01,486
I'm here in Key West. In
summertime, it's very hot and humid.

402
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:03,743
And with on AC on, I'd be freezing

403
00:24:03,744 --> 00:24:06,395
and I'd have to put on layers
of clothes just to keep warm.

404
00:24:06,396 --> 00:24:10,400
It's just like, what is going
on? What do I do to fix this?

405
00:24:10,401 --> 00:24:11,696
Type of thing.

406
00:24:11,697 --> 00:24:16,234
You thought to yourself that that
chill was a being of some sort.

407
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:17,302
- Yes.
- Okay.

408
00:24:17,303 --> 00:24:23,203
And you feel them, and it's
almost like they're right on you.

409
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:40,993
Before I arrived at the location,
I was already feeling concerned.

410
00:24:40,994 --> 00:24:43,445
The dead in the home were
hesitant to talk to me.

411
00:24:43,446 --> 00:24:47,099
Because what was waiting
behind the front door...

412
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,380
Was chaos.

413
00:24:52,481 --> 00:24:55,781
I saw, like, two graves.

414
00:24:56,233 --> 00:25:00,613
There was time between these two deaths.

415
00:25:01,056 --> 00:25:05,016
I feel like they knew each other.

416
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:09,935
One of them, he's
wearing a hat sometimes.

417
00:25:09,936 --> 00:25:13,658
And then the other guy, he was burnt.

418
00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:19,398
It was, like, in a violent
rage, and it was like a betrayal.

419
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:21,733
Kind of got off on people fighting.

420
00:25:21,734 --> 00:25:24,269
- Next...
- It's like they were on a mission.

421
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,068
The dead stalk the living.

422
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:30,369
He likes to hurt people.

423
00:25:39,335 --> 00:25:42,750
Key West, Florida, has a rich
history in all things paranormal.

424
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:45,631
And the home we investigated
there was no exception.

425
00:25:45,632 --> 00:25:49,929
Some strange experiences were making our
client, Colette, terrified in her own home.

426
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:55,352
And she was worried that the house itself
wasn't the only source of the problem.

427
00:25:55,353 --> 00:26:00,913
Well, basically, my partner, Glenn,
sees things throughout the house.

428
00:26:00,914 --> 00:26:02,377
He sees things?

429
00:26:02,378 --> 00:26:08,275
Yes. And Glenn sees all this activity...
people walking through the house.

430
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:11,718
He'll say, Colette, I can't
believe you don't see these people.

431
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:14,318
We'll be sitting here on the
couch and Glenn would say,

432
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:17,559
there they go right now. Don't
you see these people walking by?

433
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,509
They'll be up and down
through this hallway.

434
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:23,690
And I'm going, no, I don't
see it. I don't see anything.

435
00:26:23,691 --> 00:26:26,450
I don't know how these
things work, to be honest.

436
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:31,911
It'd be nice to know what's
going on in this house.

437
00:26:33,784 --> 00:26:36,149
There's people...

438
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,583
Two main people.

439
00:26:38,584 --> 00:26:41,159
There's a male.

440
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:45,000
He wanted to hurt somebody.

441
00:26:45,598 --> 00:26:49,327
As I watched the burned man spew his
hatred towards the man in the hat.

442
00:26:49,328 --> 00:26:52,378
It was becoming apparent they
had an intense rivalry in life

443
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:56,579
that had now carried over into death.

444
00:27:02,142 --> 00:27:05,322
There's more out here.

445
00:27:07,714 --> 00:27:11,398
He's had, like, something
that really bothered him.

446
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:13,106
Like, a lot of anger.

447
00:27:13,107 --> 00:27:16,407
Got to get rid of that.

448
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:26,554
Colette had some obvious
anxiety about her home.

449
00:27:26,555 --> 00:27:30,002
But her partner, on the other
hand, was a different story.

450
00:27:30,003 --> 00:27:32,987
When it comes to the dead,
nothing seemed to faze this guy.

451
00:27:32,988 --> 00:27:38,888
But what he saw would end up being
a crucial part of the investigation.

452
00:27:44,005 --> 00:27:45,017
Hi, Glenn.

453
00:27:45,018 --> 00:27:49,103
You've seen some things in the
house that Colette hasn't seen.

454
00:27:49,104 --> 00:27:51,224
Can you go into an
explanation of what you saw?

455
00:27:51,225 --> 00:27:54,845
Well, I've seen one
primary figure many times.

456
00:27:54,846 --> 00:27:59,110
And every once in a while,
there were other individuals.

457
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:02,480
Since I was 2 years old, I
have been able to see spirits.

458
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:05,371
And it never scared me.
I was never threatened.

459
00:28:05,372 --> 00:28:09,442
They did their thing. I did my thing.
I let them live. They let me live.

460
00:28:09,443 --> 00:28:11,043
- So, you know it's a male.
- Yeah.

461
00:28:11,044 --> 00:28:12,945
And it wasn't particularly friendly.

462
00:28:12,946 --> 00:28:14,380
Could you pick him out of a lineup?

463
00:28:14,381 --> 00:28:16,441
Yeah. Without a doubt.

464
00:28:16,442 --> 00:28:18,223
I think he's about 5'10 or 5'11.

465
00:28:18,224 --> 00:28:23,398
I saw white-colored slacks
and a light-colored shirt.

466
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:29,299
Seeing spirits is not an unusual
occurrence for me, but this was different.

467
00:28:29,329 --> 00:28:34,429
I saw him so vividly, I
could smell his cologne.

468
00:28:34,668 --> 00:28:40,239
This man could build things and
make things or tear them down.

469
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,986
And he tore this down, and
that gives him satisfaction.

470
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:46,347
He feels good about that.

471
00:28:48,482 --> 00:28:49,902
Can you describe him?

472
00:28:49,903 --> 00:28:54,187
There was kind of like
a white day outfit.

473
00:28:54,188 --> 00:28:57,175
A white linen shirt and a...

474
00:28:57,176 --> 00:29:00,596
Pair of white linen pants.

475
00:29:01,094 --> 00:29:04,180
The person is 5'10...

476
00:29:04,181 --> 00:29:06,429
Maybe hazel eyes.

477
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,078
And a hat sometimes.

478
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,262
Actually, kind of round.

479
00:29:11,263 --> 00:29:15,765
And a ribbon around
it... like, a straw hat.

480
00:29:15,766 --> 00:29:20,056
I could sense that the man in the
hat was the type who demanded control.

481
00:29:20,057 --> 00:29:25,957
His demeanor was generally calm, but
his actions towards people were twisted.

482
00:29:26,286 --> 00:29:28,921
There's some kind of conflict here.

483
00:29:28,922 --> 00:29:31,802
Somebody's arguing.

484
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:39,198
He kind of got off on people fighting.

485
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:44,299
He likes to hurt people.
He was not a good guy.

486
00:29:45,339 --> 00:29:49,709
They walked through the light, back and
forth, back and forth, back and forth.

487
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:53,619
The frequency of activity
with the spirits...

488
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,595
Was just many times a day.

489
00:29:56,596 --> 00:29:58,894
Two or three dozen,
four dozen, five dozen.

490
00:29:58,895 --> 00:30:02,978
It went on all day
long and all night long.

491
00:30:02,979 --> 00:30:05,000
Did they look like they
were looking for something,

492
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:06,632
or was it just they
were walking through?

493
00:30:06,633 --> 00:30:08,794
It's like they were on
a mission, so to speak.

494
00:30:08,795 --> 00:30:11,897
- Okay.
- I don't have an explanation for it.

495
00:30:11,898 --> 00:30:13,132
He shoots him in the head.

496
00:30:13,133 --> 00:30:14,267
Next...

497
00:30:14,268 --> 00:30:16,432
He is in a lot of pain.

498
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:18,871
And he was...

499
00:30:18,872 --> 00:30:19,887
Tortured.

500
00:30:19,888 --> 00:30:22,541
A bitter rivalry ends in bloodshed.

501
00:30:22,542 --> 00:30:24,076
Did he see it coming?

502
00:30:24,077 --> 00:30:26,177
No. No.

503
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,448
Digging through the records,

504
00:30:34,449 --> 00:30:37,649
I uncovered a connection between a
prominent event in Key West history,

505
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,619
and the man who built Colette's home.

506
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,005
But until I sat down with
the city's top historian,

507
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:47,906
I had no clue this case would be filled
with so many deadly twists and turns.

508
00:30:51,929 --> 00:30:54,608
The one interesting thing that
happened on Whitehead Street...

509
00:30:54,609 --> 00:30:56,348
Back in the 1920s...

510
00:30:56,349 --> 00:31:00,609
Was a murder of a man, Manuel Cabeza.

511
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:03,634
He was living with a mixed-race woman.

512
00:31:03,635 --> 00:31:07,653
Which the locals and
particularly the Ku Klux Klan...

513
00:31:07,654 --> 00:31:10,234
Disapproved of.

514
00:31:10,546 --> 00:31:13,246
He was tortured.

515
00:31:13,409 --> 00:31:16,229
And he was burnt.

516
00:31:16,492 --> 00:31:19,848
He is in a lot of pain and...

517
00:31:19,849 --> 00:31:25,749
Was very panicked over what happened
to him, very stressed out, very hurt.

518
00:31:26,126 --> 00:31:29,264
They essentially poured hot tar
on him and stuck feathers on him.

519
00:31:29,265 --> 00:31:33,353
- Literally tarred and feathered him?
- Literally tarred and feathered him.

520
00:31:33,354 --> 00:31:37,374
- Did he see it coming?
- No. No.

521
00:31:37,445 --> 00:31:41,448
The Klan had left Manuel Cabeza
for dead, but he didn't die.

522
00:31:41,449 --> 00:31:46,514
In fact, he came back with a vengeance,
and his target was their leader.

523
00:31:46,515 --> 00:31:49,177
After that, he, of
course, wanted revenge,

524
00:31:49,178 --> 00:31:53,529
because he's the tough guy and he
has to live up to his reputation.

525
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:57,664
He's fascinated, fixated on something.

526
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:01,625
Got to take care of this problem.

527
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:06,325
So, the head of the
Klan was William Decker.

528
00:32:06,326 --> 00:32:07,838
Now I had something big,

529
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:10,944
because William Decker was the
man who built Colette's house.

530
00:32:10,945 --> 00:32:15,208
So, Decker was driving
down Duval Street.

531
00:32:15,209 --> 00:32:18,372
He's in the shadows. He's
waiting. He's watching.

532
00:32:18,373 --> 00:32:23,593
It doesn't really matter
what the consequences are.

533
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:26,782
And Manuel Cabeza jumped
on the running board

534
00:32:26,783 --> 00:32:31,583
and he shot Decker in
the back of the head.

535
00:32:31,766 --> 00:32:35,006
This man killed someone?

536
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,875
Obviously killing Decker in
cold blood didn't sit right

537
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:46,805
with the police or the Klan and
Manuel Cabeza's time was running out.

538
00:32:46,806 --> 00:32:50,750
And of course Manuel Cabeza,
he's locked up in the County Jail.

539
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:56,116
So that night, the Ku Klux Klan,
they surrounded the building.

540
00:32:56,117 --> 00:33:01,877
The scenario, the Sheriff said,
is that he was overpowered.

541
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:09,485
In the middle of the
night, he was sleeping...

542
00:33:11,078 --> 00:33:13,058
And...

543
00:33:13,842 --> 00:33:17,442
They put a bag on his head.

544
00:33:19,286 --> 00:33:22,409
The KKK first went in and beat this man.

545
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,170
- Really?
- Yeah.

546
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:30,318
They have ropes, like,
with the throat, and...

547
00:33:35,129 --> 00:33:38,168
Like, not being able
to breathe very well.

548
00:33:38,169 --> 00:33:41,949
And they hung him up the pole.

549
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:48,075
The torture ended in killing him.

550
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:50,716
So, he's dead.

551
00:34:02,484 --> 00:34:05,515
The man in the hat had a
deep connection with the house

552
00:34:05,516 --> 00:34:07,928
and had no intentions of leaving.

553
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:10,882
And if the clients were going
to protect themselves from him,

554
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:14,501
I felt they needed to see his face.

555
00:34:14,502 --> 00:34:16,219
Remember his eyebrows?

556
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,977
They're not thick. They're not thin.

557
00:34:17,978 --> 00:34:22,118
And there is a slight arch to them.

558
00:34:24,078 --> 00:34:27,047
Were they big eyes, or were they thin?

559
00:34:27,048 --> 00:34:29,688
Slightly almond.

560
00:34:30,615 --> 00:34:34,021
He has, like, a sad mouth.

561
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:38,402
This goes down, and they were not full.

562
00:34:38,712 --> 00:34:42,372
A little bit of a line here.

563
00:34:43,073 --> 00:34:45,032
You remember what he had
on, what he was wearing?

564
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:49,496
He did wear a hat. It had a round brim.

565
00:34:49,497 --> 00:34:53,217
Sort of like a straw hat.

566
00:34:53,227 --> 00:34:58,567
And it did have a band,
and it was white and blue.

567
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,382
Yeah, that's him.

568
00:35:02,383 --> 00:35:04,162
Coming up next...

569
00:35:04,163 --> 00:35:06,919
It is really... it's really, really bad.

570
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,879
Secrets come to light.

571
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,858
The guy that built your
house was the head of the KKK.

572
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,633
And what happened
after the investigation?

573
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:16,930
I want him out. I'm done.

574
00:35:16,931 --> 00:35:21,311
Get out, get out, get out of my house!

575
00:35:36,183 --> 00:35:38,851
Amy, Colette owns the home and,

576
00:35:38,852 --> 00:35:43,516
probably from the minute she got
here, she felt a powerful energy.

577
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:47,048
Glenn, on the other hand,
has actually seen apparitions.

578
00:35:47,049 --> 00:35:50,082
I was anxious to meet Amy
because I really wanted to

579
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:53,951
see her and measure her
eyeball-to-eyeball, face-to-face.

580
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:58,023
To see what she was made of
and if she was really for real.

581
00:35:58,024 --> 00:36:02,344
Initially, I saw a man with a hat on.

582
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,592
And he seemed very agitated.

583
00:36:05,593 --> 00:36:08,422
I mean, he was just,
frankly, out of control.

584
00:36:08,423 --> 00:36:11,658
Glenn has actually seen a man.

585
00:36:11,659 --> 00:36:16,399
He can distinctly recall
the man's features.

586
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,843
I could see things.

587
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:22,563
The guy... I could see him
going up and down the hall.

588
00:36:22,564 --> 00:36:24,949
Amy, what else happened
during your walk?

589
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:28,365
I went into the house, and I saw a man.

590
00:36:28,366 --> 00:36:32,734
And he was talking
about how these men...

591
00:36:32,735 --> 00:36:36,591
They put a bag over his head,
and then they tortured him.

592
00:36:36,592 --> 00:36:39,652
And he looked burned.

593
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:43,243
It was really... it's
really, really bad.

594
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:45,992
That was one of those moments
where a light bulb went off.

595
00:36:45,993 --> 00:36:49,542
And I knew that Amy and
I had found the same guy.

596
00:36:49,543 --> 00:36:52,390
There was a man by the
name of Manuel Cabeza.

597
00:36:52,391 --> 00:36:54,958
Manuel was living with...

598
00:36:54,959 --> 00:36:58,015
A biracial female named Angela, who...

599
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:01,185
The KKK in Key West was
not very happy about it.

600
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:05,812
Went and grabbed him out of his apartment,
and they actually put hot tar on the guy,

601
00:37:05,813 --> 00:37:07,357
and they feathered him.

602
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:13,258
The next day, Manuel has a gun,
decides to go out and get some revenge.

603
00:37:14,005 --> 00:37:19,270
William Decker was actually the head
of the Ku Klux Klan here in Key West.

604
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:22,239
Manuel pumps a bullet into his
chest and one through his head.

605
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,240
Manuel killed Decker.

606
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:28,445
I felt like Decker got what he deserved.

607
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:31,685
Had he tarred and feathered me,
I'd have killed him in a heartbeat.

608
00:37:31,686 --> 00:37:36,587
I'd have scalped him, cut
his head off right there.

609
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:40,224
Cops show up, and he
was taken to the jail.

610
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:44,729
Short time later, the KKK wind up
getting into the jail cell somehow.

611
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:48,861
The burnt man was
talking about these men.

612
00:37:48,862 --> 00:37:51,821
And that there was a hierarchy to this.

613
00:37:51,822 --> 00:37:57,516
Then they drag him to another location
and they lynch him from a telephone pole.

614
00:37:57,517 --> 00:38:01,234
Just the fact that these two men
were murdered just so brutally.

615
00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:05,086
And the thought of their energies
being in my house all the time,

616
00:38:05,087 --> 00:38:06,884
all hours of the day...

617
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:09,909
That was my big fear.

618
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,122
More history about Mr. Decker.

619
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,526
William Decker built this home.

620
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:18,126
How do you feel about the fact
that the guy that built your house

621
00:38:18,127 --> 00:38:20,564
was the head of the KKK in Key West?

622
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:22,725
Horrible.

623
00:38:22,764 --> 00:38:27,972
I think the main thing I didn't like
was the fact that Decker built my house.

624
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:30,340
And he was the head of the KKK.

625
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:35,201
That was just shocking
to me... just shocking.

626
00:38:35,485 --> 00:38:38,243
Now, what I try to do
when I work with Amy,

627
00:38:38,244 --> 00:38:43,224
is I try to bring in a
sketch artist for her.

628
00:38:45,064 --> 00:38:47,184
He look familiar at all?

629
00:38:47,185 --> 00:38:51,395
That's him. That's the
gentleman that I saw.

630
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:56,196
I'm gonna show you a
picture of Mr. Decker.

631
00:38:57,344 --> 00:39:02,239
That is the gentleman in the
hallway, walking up and down.

632
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,638
When Glenn said, this is
the man I've been seeing,

633
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:06,445
chills went down my spine.

634
00:39:06,446 --> 00:39:08,612
Just made it even more real.

635
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:11,553
It's pretty creepy.

636
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,430
Wow. Okay.

637
00:39:14,882 --> 00:39:20,702
This, to me, definitely looks
like the person I encountered.

638
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:28,465
Amy, why are these people
still staying in this house?

639
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:34,205
They're both kind of in denial about the
parts that they played in what happened.

640
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:37,887
So one is, you know, the eternal victim.

641
00:39:37,888 --> 00:39:40,674
And the other one, he thinks
he was completely right.

642
00:39:40,675 --> 00:39:46,575
And I think that that's hindering them
from being able to take the next step.

643
00:39:47,977 --> 00:39:51,095
So, that violence or
just the way they died,

644
00:39:51,096 --> 00:39:55,991
does that energy hang in
this house or this area?

645
00:39:55,992 --> 00:40:01,032
I think you're asking
Amy if you're safe here.

646
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:21,418
Amy said that I needed
to protect myself.

647
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:26,463
And there's a lot of energies out
there and they're not all good energies.

648
00:40:26,464 --> 00:40:29,584
Especially around here.

649
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:33,509
In order to protect myself,
I regularly cleanse the home.

650
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:37,773
By burning Sage around the
property and spraying...

651
00:40:37,774 --> 00:40:39,703
Herbal liquids.

652
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:42,039
All negative energy, out.

653
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,088
Get out of my house.

654
00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:47,249
Get out!

655
00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:51,949
My regular cleansing helps,
but they keep coming back.

656
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:56,861
Colette tries to practice cleansing
home and property or whatever.

657
00:40:56,862 --> 00:41:01,182
And to sum it up, I think it's B.S.

658
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:05,796
The spirits are still in this
house. I still see Decker.

659
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:11,168
There are times when I hear the floors
creak and I look up and there's Decker.

660
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:14,438
I just want Decker to leave. I don't
know why he keeps hanging around.

661
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:16,473
I want him out.

662
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,982
I want him out of the house. I'm done.

663
00:41:18,983 --> 00:41:22,213
Get out, get out, get
out of my house, Decker!

664
00:41:22,214 --> 00:41:24,374
Get out!

665
00:41:24,412 --> 00:41:25,316
Get out!

666
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:29,277
Get out of my house, Decker. Out!

667
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,427
Spirits...

668
00:41:31,428 --> 00:41:34,930
Either they are around you
or they are not around you.

669
00:41:34,931 --> 00:41:39,219
They are there or they are not there,
and you can't do anything about it.

670
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:42,099
This is just part of life,
and that's part of my life...

671
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,640
My whole life, all my life.

672
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:49,497
The measures Colette has taken
to protect herself and her home.

673
00:41:49,498 --> 00:41:51,641
Should keep the activity at a minimum.

674
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,511
But it seems the dead are always
going to find their way to Glenn.

675
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:58,829
I'm hopeful that he and Colette
will work together to find a balance.
