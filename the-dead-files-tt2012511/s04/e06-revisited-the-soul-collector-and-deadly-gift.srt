1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
David Coleman.

2
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:08,545
Tonight on "Dead Files Revisited"...

3
00:00:08,546 --> 00:00:10,755
He wants to kill me.

4
00:00:10,756 --> 00:00:14,999
A second look at some of Amy and
Steve's most terrifying cases.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,031
If I heard that, I'd reach for my gun.

6
00:00:17,032 --> 00:00:18,269
New information.

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,614
It was just disturbing.

8
00:00:19,615 --> 00:00:21,377
Startling revelations.

9
00:00:21,378 --> 00:00:23,987
I felt like Amy could look into my soul.

10
00:00:23,988 --> 00:00:25,711
First...

11
00:00:25,712 --> 00:00:28,070
A return to Parkersburg,
West Virginia...

12
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:29,260
I want it to be over...

13
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:31,306
Where a demonic Creature
tortures a family.

14
00:00:31,307 --> 00:00:33,575
We can't continue to live in fear.

15
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:36,686
And Amy reveals the horrifying truth.

16
00:00:36,687 --> 00:00:39,807
He wants to hurt you.

17
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,098
Then we travel back
to Wichita, Kansas...

18
00:00:43,099 --> 00:00:45,470
It made my heart stop.

19
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:47,918
Where evil lurks around every corner.

20
00:00:47,919 --> 00:00:49,986
He hates them, living or dead.

21
00:00:49,987 --> 00:00:52,523
And the client faces a grim reality.

22
00:00:52,524 --> 00:00:54,187
Is that me?

23
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:55,957
Did they follow Amy's advice...

24
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,461
You guys are gonna do this stuff?

25
00:00:57,462 --> 00:00:59,530
Or continue to live in fear?

26
00:00:59,531 --> 00:01:02,591
I have felt hopeless.

27
00:01:03,535 --> 00:01:05,978
They're being watched.

28
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:08,908
My name is Amy Allan.

29
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,110
This thing likes death.

30
00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:12,845
I see dead people.

31
00:01:12,846 --> 00:01:14,304
This thing's, like, a monster.

32
00:01:14,305 --> 00:01:16,516
I speak to dead people.

33
00:01:16,517 --> 00:01:18,050
And he's pissed off now.

34
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:19,546
And they speak to me.

35
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:21,262
His head was cracked.

36
00:01:21,263 --> 00:01:24,857
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

37
00:01:24,858 --> 00:01:26,245
This guy was murdered.

38
00:01:26,246 --> 00:01:27,780
I rely on my partner.

39
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:31,039
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

40
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,623
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

41
00:01:33,624 --> 00:01:36,960
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

42
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:38,395
You saw her?

43
00:01:38,396 --> 00:01:39,629
It's my job to reveal them.

44
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,897
Why would you stay here?

45
00:01:40,898 --> 00:01:43,019
But Steve and I never speak...

46
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,003
We never communicate
during an investigation.

47
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:46,371
Until the very end.

48
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,206
Stop it.

49
00:01:48,207 --> 00:01:50,162
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

50
00:01:50,163 --> 00:01:52,723
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

51
00:01:52,724 --> 00:01:53,978
Or time to get out.

52
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:58,719
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

53
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:17,436
It takes a lot to rattle my cage,

54
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:21,606
but our investigation in Parkersburg,
West Virginia, still haunts me.

55
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:24,943
Our client's family had been terrorized
by paranormal activity for years,

56
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:27,779
especially her 17-year-old
daughter, Torie.

57
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,614
I'll never forget the
look of fear in her eyes

58
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:34,319
when Amy revealed what was
really going on in their house.

59
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,155
Well, Tisha, tell me why
you called Amy and I in.

60
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:39,091
We are having some
activity in the house.

61
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,593
Some of us have been physically touched.

62
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,595
The kids are scared.

63
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:47,499
Well, just last night,
our oldest was hysterical,

64
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,668
and I spent a lot of
the night consoling her.

65
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:53,171
I was at a place, as a Mom,

66
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:56,878
where I had felt hopeless
about protecting my children.

67
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,060
When there's something in
your house that you can't see

68
00:02:59,061 --> 00:03:03,681
and you don't even know what it is, you
can't really keep your kids safe from that.

69
00:03:03,682 --> 00:03:06,485
You think that whatever's here
can be harmful to you guys?

70
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:10,566
We can't continue to live in fear.

71
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:28,826
What's going on?

72
00:03:31,988 --> 00:03:34,494
Well, there was, like,
someone who was drowned.

73
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:38,575
There's a male who's following us.

74
00:03:39,112 --> 00:03:43,552
Somehow, these two
incidents are related.

75
00:03:44,802 --> 00:03:47,823
I already sensed that
the house had a dark past,

76
00:03:47,824 --> 00:03:50,326
but I didn't even have
to walk in the front door

77
00:03:50,327 --> 00:03:53,662
to know that the man
protecting it was evil.

78
00:03:53,663 --> 00:03:58,867
He just keeps smiling, and the
smile is, like, really maniacal.

79
00:03:58,868 --> 00:04:03,848
He wants to kill me,
and he's waiting for me.

80
00:04:07,612 --> 00:04:08,978
Okay, what's going on up here?

81
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:12,281
We're lying in bed at
night, and we hear sounds.

82
00:04:12,282 --> 00:04:14,934
They're usually coming from this floor.

83
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:17,995
And it sounds like...

84
00:04:19,956 --> 00:04:21,859
- Just like that.
- That noisy?

85
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,875
All night long.

86
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:25,193
If I heard that, I'd reach
for my gun and come running up.

87
00:04:25,194 --> 00:04:26,544
Yeah.

88
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:29,267
Well, you can only imagine
the toll that it took on us.

89
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:31,687
I was tired, the kids were
having trouble getting up

90
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,834
and going to school
because of late nights.

91
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:39,535
So, it took a huge toll on
our bodies and on our souls.

92
00:04:39,752 --> 00:04:44,012
There's, like, lots of **** people.

93
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,179
Upstairs is just full of...

94
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:52,228
Crying... and people...

95
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:58,021
That really don't belong.

96
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,799
I couldn't believe how many dead
people were trapped in that attic.

97
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,803
But out of all of them,
one stood out from the rest.

98
00:05:05,804 --> 00:05:09,407
There's a dead little girl here.

99
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:13,628
She stumbles into things all the time.

100
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:15,753
Where does this happen...
that she bumps into things?

101
00:05:15,754 --> 00:05:19,234
All over the **** house.

102
00:05:24,627 --> 00:05:27,370
Jason, Tisha says you're a
skeptic. Is that accurate?

103
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:31,274
I'm always trying to find the
logical, you know, explanations.

104
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:33,842
But as time goes on and things happen,

105
00:05:33,843 --> 00:05:37,485
you know, you start to
run out of explanations.

106
00:05:37,486 --> 00:05:40,650
Usually, the man of the house will
play the skeptical card with me.

107
00:05:40,651 --> 00:05:42,151
Jason was no different.

108
00:05:42,152 --> 00:05:43,740
But once I pressed him,

109
00:05:43,741 --> 00:05:46,855
it wasn't long before he admitted
that he was also a believer.

110
00:05:46,856 --> 00:05:50,025
Did any experience that you
had here change your mind?

111
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:51,503
Yes.

112
00:05:51,504 --> 00:05:54,251
I was shaving in the bathroom,

113
00:05:54,252 --> 00:05:58,834
and my daughter usually comes up, you
know, to give me a hug, and I felt that.

114
00:05:58,835 --> 00:06:02,738
And I looked around and
there was no one there.

115
00:06:02,739 --> 00:06:05,238
Is that the defining moment
that changed your attitude?

116
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:08,119
- Yes.
- Okay.

117
00:06:11,114 --> 00:06:14,565
There's a teenage boy here.

118
00:06:14,566 --> 00:06:19,066
And he's laughing, and he's a prankster.

119
00:06:20,706 --> 00:06:24,906
Does he do stuff to the living here?

120
00:06:24,988 --> 00:06:26,848
Yes.

121
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:30,597
He watches them, always...

122
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,373
Breathes on them...

123
00:06:33,374 --> 00:06:39,274
Likes to walk around and, like,
walking up right behind them.

124
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:42,044
At first, I just assumed
that boy was nothing more

125
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:44,600
than an entity who
liked causing trouble.

126
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:47,049
But something about him was deceiving.

127
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,893
And then I saw there was a
sinister side to his pranks.

128
00:06:50,894 --> 00:06:53,389
He likes to surprise them.

129
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,150
Sometimes, like...

130
00:06:56,225 --> 00:07:00,125
Get in there and asphyxiate them.

131
00:07:07,672 --> 00:07:10,256
It was one thing to hear
Tisha and Jason's stories.

132
00:07:10,257 --> 00:07:11,579
But as a father,

133
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,480
it was tough seeing how those
experiences were torturing their daughter.

134
00:07:23,224 --> 00:07:24,576
So, Torie, I was talking to Mom,

135
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,873
and she told me you had a
pretty bad night last night.

136
00:07:26,874 --> 00:07:31,416
I was laying in bed, and I kept
hearing furniture moving upstairs.

137
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,863
So, I called Mom and she
tried to calm me down,

138
00:07:34,864 --> 00:07:37,790
so I slept in the same
room as my grandpa.

139
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,312
I was so scared to sleep in my room

140
00:07:40,313 --> 00:07:43,054
that I would crawl in bed
with one of my family members.

141
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:46,523
And being 17, that's really
embarrassing for me to,

142
00:07:46,524 --> 00:07:49,353
tell other people or my
friends about that, because...

143
00:07:49,354 --> 00:07:52,823
I don't want people to
make fun of me about it.

144
00:07:52,824 --> 00:07:56,220
Your Mother mentioned that she felt
like she was always being watched.

145
00:07:56,221 --> 00:07:58,321
- Yeah.
- Where do you feel that?

146
00:07:58,322 --> 00:08:01,502
Definitely the bathroom
on the second floor.

147
00:08:01,503 --> 00:08:04,870
Just, when I take a shower, I
always got to open the curtain,

148
00:08:04,871 --> 00:08:07,069
look out, because I feel
like someone's standing there.

149
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,250
That's when it starts.

150
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,269
The boy from upstairs...
the prankster...

151
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,378
He watches everything all the time.

152
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:20,523
No privacy here. No. None. None.

153
00:08:20,524 --> 00:08:25,141
And he said, "I don't care
if they feel violated".

154
00:08:25,142 --> 00:08:27,962
It's really mean.

155
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,493
You know, Torie, I have a daughter
myself. She's a little bit older than you.

156
00:08:31,494 --> 00:08:35,452
Couldn't imagine her going
through this every night.

157
00:08:35,453 --> 00:08:38,038
It's got to be tough on you.

158
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,039
Okay. Wait a minute.

159
00:08:44,648 --> 00:08:47,708
This is really scary.

160
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:54,716
And I worry about the kids all the time.

161
00:08:54,717 --> 00:08:57,051
I'm worried about my Mom, too.

162
00:08:57,052 --> 00:09:00,232
I want it to be over.

163
00:09:01,256 --> 00:09:02,470
Yes.

164
00:09:02,471 --> 00:09:04,913
- Next...
- **** it hurts.

165
00:09:04,914 --> 00:09:06,864
Amy is under attack.

166
00:09:06,865 --> 00:09:09,233
I got to get him out. I got to...

167
00:09:09,234 --> 00:09:11,699
And in our second investigation...

168
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,923
If you run, they're gonna follow you.

169
00:09:14,924 --> 00:09:16,774
Lives are changed forever.

170
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:21,995
For us, the final chapter
hasn't been written yet.

171
00:09:34,017 --> 00:09:37,002
After doing some research
on Tisha and Jason's house,

172
00:09:37,003 --> 00:09:41,173
I found out two people were killed
on the property about 100 years ago.

173
00:09:41,174 --> 00:09:43,843
And the cause of their
death was so bizarre,

174
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:49,124
I tracked down a local
author to explain it to me.

175
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:57,424
In 1885, the city of Parkersburg built

176
00:09:57,425 --> 00:10:00,609
two large water tanks on Quincy Hill.

177
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:05,123
And then on march 19, 1909,
the South tank ruptured,

178
00:10:05,124 --> 00:10:07,943
and the force of the water
caused the North tank to rupture.

179
00:10:07,944 --> 00:10:12,464
2 million gallons of water just
instantly flooded Parkersburg.

180
00:10:12,465 --> 00:10:16,699
And there were a lot of homes
in the surrounding area that were

181
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,494
ripped off their foundations and
thrown into the streets below.

182
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,958
So, now, a young couple gets killed.

183
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,771
Yes. Their house was swept
down into Avery Street.

184
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:29,848
Were their bodies ever found?

185
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:34,445
A few hours later,
their bodies were found.

186
00:10:34,446 --> 00:10:37,873
Their hands and arms
were over their mouths,

187
00:10:37,874 --> 00:10:41,792
as if they were trying to
get another breath of air.

188
00:10:41,793 --> 00:10:43,653
Wow.

189
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:51,229
Like, seeing the water again.

190
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,111
Shaking, and I'm
falling, and I'm falling.

191
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,374
Like ****!

192
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,710
Down, down.

193
00:10:58,711 --> 00:11:02,019
Covered up, covered up. Shh!

194
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,684
All I could see around me was
death and destruction, and then...

195
00:11:05,685 --> 00:11:08,099
**** it hurts. Aw...

196
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,989
Are you okay?

197
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:15,827
An entity forced his way into my body
to make me experience his suffering.

198
00:11:15,828 --> 00:11:21,352
The pain was so unbearable, it took
every ounce of my strength to break free.

199
00:11:21,353 --> 00:11:23,393
****

200
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:27,898
I got to get him out. I got...

201
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:31,559
I got to get him out of me.

202
00:11:32,535 --> 00:11:37,849
He just wants everybody to
know that he was **** killed.

203
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,520
The water towers were built by
a prominent Parkersburg family.

204
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:44,312
At the center of that family
was General John Jay Jackson...

205
00:11:44,313 --> 00:11:47,358
A well-respected man with an
impeccable military record.

206
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:51,530
On paper, that sounds nice, but
after talking to a local historian,

207
00:11:51,531 --> 00:11:57,351
I learned that the General
wasn't always such a great guy.

208
00:11:58,337 --> 00:12:02,007
I came across the name of
a General John Jay Jackson.

209
00:12:02,008 --> 00:12:06,745
Yes. He was a Founding Father
of the city of Parkersburg.

210
00:12:06,746 --> 00:12:08,868
So, Bob, how did he make a living?

211
00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:13,198
In the 1840s, he purchased
a Parkersburg newspaper.

212
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:18,456
And then soon thereafter, he
became involved in the oil industry.

213
00:12:18,457 --> 00:12:20,258
What kind of a businessman was he?

214
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:25,054
Anytime you're buying land
and speculating, there's...

215
00:12:25,055 --> 00:12:26,733
Often controversy.

216
00:12:26,734 --> 00:12:30,124
And this certainly may have been
the case involving General Jackson.

217
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,104
Okay. Now, what about family?

218
00:12:33,105 --> 00:12:36,765
Legend has it that his son...

219
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:41,308
John Jay Junior, that had fallen
in love with a girl in Parkersburg,

220
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:44,712
named Jane, whom he
planned to marry himself.

221
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:48,954
However, this happened to be the
same Jane that his father married.

222
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:51,790
So, he married the Jane that the
Son was looking to hook up with?

223
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,371
- Yes.
- Okay.

224
00:12:57,046 --> 00:13:02,618
So, now I'm seeing this guy, and
he's just wearing a long black duster.

225
00:13:02,619 --> 00:13:05,288
I was nervous being near that man again.

226
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:09,679
I saw him when I first arrived at the
house, and he threatened to kill me.

227
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,066
He was here from...

228
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:14,287
Way back.

229
00:13:14,714 --> 00:13:17,474
Eighteen sixty's.

230
00:13:17,573 --> 00:13:21,037
And he was a prominent person.

231
00:13:21,038 --> 00:13:22,790
He...

232
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,170
Was...

233
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:28,127
Instrumental in this town's growth.

234
00:13:28,128 --> 00:13:29,953
All of a sudden, his body changed

235
00:13:29,954 --> 00:13:33,683
and he revealed himself to
me as a horrific Creature.

236
00:13:33,684 --> 00:13:39,219
An entity like this can be extremely
dangerous to both the living and the dead.

237
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:44,440
So I knew I needed to
sketch him for our clients.

238
00:13:52,613 --> 00:13:54,947
He is very tall...

239
00:13:54,948 --> 00:13:56,782
And he is...

240
00:13:56,783 --> 00:14:01,043
Like a skeleton with a layer of skin.

241
00:14:01,351 --> 00:14:05,911
He's wearing a very
thick leather jacket.

242
00:14:09,118 --> 00:14:12,178
Is this who you saw?

243
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:15,078
Yes.

244
00:14:15,286 --> 00:14:16,286
Next...

245
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:18,484
He wants to do harm.

246
00:14:18,485 --> 00:14:20,189
God.

247
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,841
Find out what happened
after the investigation.

248
00:14:22,842 --> 00:14:24,449
My Mom was screaming.

249
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:30,350
In the name of the Father and the
Son and the Holy Spirit, get out!

250
00:14:54,362 --> 00:14:58,230
Amy, this is Tisha and Jason.
They're engaged to be married.

251
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,460
They've been going through
some terrifying things.

252
00:15:00,461 --> 00:15:04,130
Torie, especially. Torie's
their oldest. She's 17.

253
00:15:04,131 --> 00:15:07,301
I was so excited to see Amy
sitting at our kitchen table.

254
00:15:07,302 --> 00:15:10,804
I felt like, finally, finally,
we're going to have answers.

255
00:15:10,805 --> 00:15:13,139
And we're gonna have a
way to protect our kids.

256
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:16,510
But I had one big concern...
that Amy was going to say,

257
00:15:16,511 --> 00:15:20,177
"you need to move out of your house".

258
00:15:20,178 --> 00:15:23,607
When I first came onto the property...

259
00:15:23,608 --> 00:15:27,225
I saw that somebody had drowned.

260
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:31,238
I already knew that the two water tanks
ruptured and flooded the town in 1909.

261
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:33,570
Three people died from it.

262
00:15:33,571 --> 00:15:38,935
And they found them with their mouths
covered, as if to stop water from going in.

263
00:15:38,936 --> 00:15:42,988
But I never expected that Amy would
have seen that tragedy in such detail.

264
00:15:42,989 --> 00:15:46,768
And I felt, like, this
blow, then I heard...

265
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:50,249
"Down, cover up, cover up".

266
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:52,394
Anything else?

267
00:15:52,395 --> 00:15:56,560
Okay. So, there's two
people on the second floor.

268
00:15:56,561 --> 00:15:58,678
One is a younger girl.

269
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:02,971
She tends to accidentally
bang into things.

270
00:16:02,972 --> 00:16:06,419
The other one is a younger male.

271
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,189
He also likes the bathroom a lot.

272
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:13,510
- He likes to be in there.
- God.

273
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:17,950
When Amy told me that she discovered
the little boy in the bathroom...

274
00:16:17,951 --> 00:16:21,673
I got really emotional,
because I was worried.

275
00:16:21,674 --> 00:16:24,525
For myself and my siblings.

276
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,439
If one of them had to go through this,

277
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,660
I can only imagine how
hard it would be for them.

278
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:39,099
He watches all the time.
He wants to hurt you.

279
00:16:39,152 --> 00:16:41,312
God.

280
00:16:42,398 --> 00:16:45,024
Seeing Torie break down
like that was very difficult.

281
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:48,314
I didn't know what to say to her,
and I didn't know what to do for her.

282
00:16:48,315 --> 00:16:52,752
And at that moment, I
felt like I had failed.

283
00:16:52,753 --> 00:16:55,426
I failed my child.

284
00:16:55,427 --> 00:16:57,459
What else did you see?

285
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,367
The other person...

286
00:16:59,368 --> 00:17:01,703
He is the man in the black coat.

287
00:17:01,704 --> 00:17:05,124
And he wanted to kill me.

288
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:09,314
He's from the 1860s or '70s...

289
00:17:09,315 --> 00:17:14,535
And he was very instrumental
in creating this town.

290
00:17:14,693 --> 00:17:17,827
That sounds just like John Jay Jackson.

291
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,255
He owned the property
that your house sits on.

292
00:17:21,256 --> 00:17:26,994
He was one of the Founding
Fathers, actually, of Parkersburg.

293
00:17:29,017 --> 00:17:31,333
Do you think the apparition
you saw is General Jackson?

294
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:34,034
Yes. Yes, I do.

295
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:40,140
But he also showed me another side of
himself in a really dark, sinister way.

296
00:17:40,141 --> 00:17:45,781
I sketched him that way because
it really was disturbing.

297
00:17:45,948 --> 00:17:48,316
Take a look, guys.

298
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:52,976
He has no pupils.

299
00:17:53,054 --> 00:17:57,492
God. The man's eyes. He
didn't even have eyes.

300
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,662
It was the creepiest
face I had ever seen.

301
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:05,900
It just... when you look at it, you feel
a bad presence just even from the picture.

302
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:09,081
It was just disturbing.

303
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:12,980
He's a collector.

304
00:18:12,981 --> 00:18:16,871
With his life, all of the
collecting he did then of, like,

305
00:18:16,872 --> 00:18:19,213
maybe property and
money and all of this.

306
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:24,151
The only thing in death that
you can really collect are souls.

307
00:18:24,152 --> 00:18:28,648
He and the little boy
are one in the same.

308
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,921
He has this part of himself
that's this little boy...

309
00:18:32,922 --> 00:18:35,840
That can do all these horrible things.

310
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:41,061
While his other self is
literally roaming the town.

311
00:18:43,196 --> 00:18:46,207
I know this is a lot of
information to digest in one night,

312
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,188
but the most pressing question...

313
00:18:48,189 --> 00:18:50,238
Is it safe for your family to be here?

314
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,814
I can't answer that, so for that,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

315
00:18:52,815 --> 00:18:58,093
You have so much residual
energy here, it's ridiculous.

316
00:18:58,094 --> 00:19:01,355
So, the first thing
to do is a cleansing.

317
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:03,155
Yeah.

318
00:19:03,156 --> 00:19:05,036
The other thing is, in each room,

319
00:19:05,037 --> 00:19:09,519
you're gonna take salt and throw
it in the four corners of each room.

320
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,800
They're gonna all be attracted to this.

321
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:16,742
This will cleanse all the residual
energy, and you're sealing the property,

322
00:19:16,743 --> 00:19:20,763
so nothing else negative can enter.

323
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,800
Promise me you guys are
gonna do what she says.

324
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:46,748
Amy gave us the advice that we needed
to do the cleansing of the house.

325
00:19:46,749 --> 00:19:52,649
And I looked at Torie and said,
"that's it. It's getting done".

326
00:19:54,973 --> 00:20:00,313
As quickly as we could, we
were cleansing the house.

327
00:20:00,428 --> 00:20:03,451
We ask that all negativity
leave this space.

328
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,989
You're no longer welcome in this home.

329
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:12,460
Then we went into the basement, which
is a place that I had never gone before.

330
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,730
We ask that all negative
energy leave this place today.

331
00:20:15,731 --> 00:20:19,429
You are no longer welcome in our home.

332
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,188
Only love, light, and peace may enter.

333
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:28,469
And doing the salt...
sweeping it out of the house.

334
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:30,912
During the cleanse, I was still scared,

335
00:20:30,913 --> 00:20:34,616
and the mood didn't
really change at all.

336
00:20:34,617 --> 00:20:37,819
And then we went into the bathroom,

337
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:42,690
that I am terrified of,
and right when we walked in,

338
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:46,651
I felt something pull on my hair.

339
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:50,668
Mom, something just pulled on my hair.

340
00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:52,665
Okay. We're done.

341
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,904
In the name of the Father and the
Son and the Holy Spirit, get out!

342
00:20:55,905 --> 00:20:58,815
We ask that all negative
energy leave our home.

343
00:20:58,816 --> 00:21:02,041
Leave our home! Leave us in peace!

344
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:03,759
My Mom was screaming.

345
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,128
Get out of our house! This is our home!

346
00:21:08,129 --> 00:21:12,654
She was telling it to get out of here
and it didn't belong in our house.

347
00:21:12,655 --> 00:21:15,189
I was so angry.

348
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,259
Leave us alone. This is our home.

349
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,740
Get out!

350
00:21:19,741 --> 00:21:21,557
I knew he was there with us.

351
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:24,460
And that just gave me
more energy and drive,

352
00:21:24,461 --> 00:21:29,321
to get the house cleansed
completely that day.

353
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:36,804
After the cleanse, this house
felt completely different.

354
00:21:36,805 --> 00:21:40,356
Everything felt lighter.
The house was warmer.

355
00:21:40,357 --> 00:21:43,025
It was an obvious change.

356
00:21:43,026 --> 00:21:45,361
Now I can sleep at night.

357
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:47,697
I can go to the
bathroom without anybody,

358
00:21:47,698 --> 00:21:51,709
and I don't have to be
scared to be at home alone.

359
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,222
I'm not sure if it's a coincidence...

360
00:21:54,223 --> 00:21:57,840
But Jason and I have planned
our wedding four times.

361
00:21:57,841 --> 00:22:00,147
He has canceled it three times.

362
00:22:00,148 --> 00:22:03,012
Since the cleansing, he's
in a much better mood,

363
00:22:03,013 --> 00:22:07,633
and we were finally
married two weeks ago.

364
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:11,220
Tisha and Torie have
taken the right steps

365
00:22:11,221 --> 00:22:13,556
to release the dead from their home.

366
00:22:13,557 --> 00:22:17,560
But they should continue the
cleansings on a regular basis.

367
00:22:17,561 --> 00:22:20,104
The man in the black
coat is still out there,

368
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:25,085
and there is no telling
when he's coming back.

369
00:22:37,714 --> 00:22:39,882
A couple in Wichita,
Kansas, called us in

370
00:22:39,883 --> 00:22:43,072
to investigate frightening
activity on their property.

371
00:22:43,073 --> 00:22:47,744
Turns out the problem wasn't just
their building, it was one of them.

372
00:22:47,745 --> 00:22:50,009
And even though Amy
and I were able to help,

373
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,156
this is one story that's far from over.

374
00:22:53,157 --> 00:22:55,479
Jeff, you sounded
concerned on the phone.

375
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,153
Well, I am concerned.

376
00:22:57,154 --> 00:22:59,664
You know, really, I'm fighting
to save two businesses here.

377
00:22:59,665 --> 00:23:02,071
- My wife has the salon here in front.
- Okay.

378
00:23:02,072 --> 00:23:03,888
And then I have my
garage here at the back.

379
00:23:03,889 --> 00:23:05,323
Give me an idea of what's going on.

380
00:23:05,324 --> 00:23:08,898
We've heard things, we've
been touched, pushed.

381
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:11,100
I'd like my kids to be able
to take over the business.

382
00:23:11,101 --> 00:23:13,770
But right now, I'm not even
comfortable having them in there.

383
00:23:13,771 --> 00:23:15,689
This is a big part of our lives.

384
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:20,109
We've spent so much money and so
much effort building this business up,

385
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,946
and we've been very successful here,

386
00:23:22,947 --> 00:23:25,949
so it would be very difficult
just to pull up and move.

387
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,920
What about yourself... have you ever
seen anything or experienced anything?

388
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:30,787
I just finished working
on some vehicles.

389
00:23:30,788 --> 00:23:32,686
- Okay.
- And I looked up and saw it.

390
00:23:32,687 --> 00:23:35,381
Looked like an older gentleman, maybe.

391
00:23:35,382 --> 00:23:38,929
I'm guessing him to be in his
mid to late 50s, with a beard.

392
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,430
All of us went inside.

393
00:23:40,431 --> 00:23:45,231
We found out that there
was nobody in there.

394
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,400
Okay.

395
00:24:01,335 --> 00:24:03,286
There's one kind of creepy dude.

396
00:24:03,287 --> 00:24:06,278
He's kind of like a greaser dude.

397
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:09,029
And he likes his area.

398
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,061
To me, he's, like, just
a tough guy, you know?

399
00:24:12,062 --> 00:24:16,351
He's like, "I'm tough.
I'm bad. I'm big. I'm bad".

400
00:24:16,352 --> 00:24:21,390
During my walks, I often encounter
entities who act very territorial.

401
00:24:21,391 --> 00:24:26,405
Usually, it's because they want to
protect their space, but the greaser guy...

402
00:24:26,406 --> 00:24:29,977
He wanted revenge on the
people who had invaded his home.

403
00:24:29,978 --> 00:24:33,887
Like, would you say that he's dangerous?

404
00:24:33,888 --> 00:24:35,748
Yes.

405
00:24:36,821 --> 00:24:39,143
He's kind of **** up.

406
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,548
Next...

407
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:41,946
He can get physical.

408
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,880
Amy has a sickening encounter.

409
00:24:43,881 --> 00:24:47,961
It's, like, really hurting my head.

410
00:25:02,061 --> 00:25:04,223
Amy and I were investigating not one,

411
00:25:04,224 --> 00:25:07,727
but two family-run businesses,
both on the same property.

412
00:25:07,728 --> 00:25:10,730
The activity had gotten so
bad that the owner, Jeff,

413
00:25:10,731 --> 00:25:15,714
was concerned that his reputation
wasn't the only thing in danger.

414
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:17,737
So, what's going on in here?

415
00:25:17,738 --> 00:25:20,339
I remember a time I was
leaned over the back of a car,

416
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,635
and then suddenly someone
whispers in my ear.

417
00:25:24,636 --> 00:25:27,980
I stand up. There was nothing in here.

418
00:25:27,981 --> 00:25:29,649
Anything else, Jeff?

419
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:33,295
We started to notice that
tools would come up missing.

420
00:25:33,296 --> 00:25:36,408
If you can't find them,
you can't work with them.

421
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:40,522
Do you think that anything that's
going on in the garage can be dangerous?

422
00:25:40,523 --> 00:25:41,892
Yes.

423
00:25:41,893 --> 00:25:44,220
I was really worried
about everyone's safety.

424
00:25:44,221 --> 00:25:46,250
Because I felt like,

425
00:25:46,251 --> 00:25:49,526
if it could move something small
or throw, like, a roll of tape,

426
00:25:49,527 --> 00:25:54,774
that it could definitely
throw something big or sharp.

427
00:25:54,775 --> 00:25:57,476
He doesn't want anybody in
his space. He hates them.

428
00:25:57,477 --> 00:26:02,484
Living or dead, he just doesn't
want anybody in this space.

429
00:26:02,485 --> 00:26:05,184
Some people think of the
dead as transparent beings

430
00:26:05,185 --> 00:26:08,126
who have very little
interaction with our world.

431
00:26:08,127 --> 00:26:12,542
That's somewhat correct, but the stronger
ones can actually break the physical plane.

432
00:26:12,543 --> 00:26:18,254
And if provoked, they can touch the living,
move objects, or do something worse.

433
00:26:18,255 --> 00:26:21,234
He can get physical if he wants to...

434
00:26:21,235 --> 00:26:24,169
Grabbing or pushing.

435
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,309
- Okay.
- Likes to throw things.

436
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,109
Could he hurt anybody?

437
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:31,950
I think he... I think he could.

438
00:26:34,562 --> 00:26:37,319
Jeff had his fair share of
problems on the property,

439
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,062
but he wasn't the type
of guy to just run away.

440
00:26:40,063 --> 00:26:42,780
His wife, on the other
hand, was ready to split.

441
00:26:42,781 --> 00:26:44,753
But soon, we were all about to find out

442
00:26:44,754 --> 00:26:50,094
there was no way she could
have run away from this.

443
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:57,453
So, Emily, I was talking to your husband,
Jeff, and he basically said you're ready

444
00:26:57,454 --> 00:27:00,805
to put the "for sale" sign on this place
and get out of here. What's going on?

445
00:27:00,806 --> 00:27:05,436
From the first time we unlocked the door
here, it's never felt like it's been ours.

446
00:27:05,437 --> 00:27:06,795
Why do you say that?

447
00:27:06,796 --> 00:27:12,696
Stuff moves, people get pushed, you
hear people whisper in your ears.

448
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,747
Okay, so you're losing business
because of what's going on?

449
00:27:15,748 --> 00:27:17,581
Absolutely.

450
00:27:17,582 --> 00:27:19,698
So many people have
had experiences here.

451
00:27:19,699 --> 00:27:21,861
It's a small town, and word gets around.

452
00:27:21,862 --> 00:27:27,088
So, I don't want to get a bad
name for being the haunted salon.

453
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:29,127
I'd love for it all to stop and go away,

454
00:27:29,128 --> 00:27:32,964
but I just don't know if
that's what's gonna happen.

455
00:27:32,965 --> 00:27:35,366
All right, so you feel that
whatever's here wants you out?

456
00:27:35,367 --> 00:27:37,647
Absolutely.

457
00:27:41,974 --> 00:27:46,828
There's a lot of stuff
coming in from outside.

458
00:27:46,829 --> 00:27:51,449
I'm, like, seeing
this woman who's alive.

459
00:27:51,499 --> 00:27:54,846
The dead are just, like, following her.

460
00:27:54,847 --> 00:27:58,147
And then they're inside.

461
00:27:58,657 --> 00:28:00,685
That was the moment I realized,

462
00:28:00,686 --> 00:28:05,830
the dead there were attracted to a
specific person for a very specific reason.

463
00:28:05,831 --> 00:28:07,665
Why are they following her?

464
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:10,909
Because she has abilities.

465
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:13,450
Okay, so what's going on here?

466
00:28:13,451 --> 00:28:15,713
My daughter talks about seeing things.

467
00:28:15,714 --> 00:28:19,869
She even drew a picture of, like,
a black figure with red eyes,

468
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,865
and she said that's
something she saw here.

469
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,948
- Where's the picture?
- I threw it away immediately.

470
00:28:23,949 --> 00:28:27,719
It made my heart stop, because I
don't want to be putting her in danger.

471
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,087
Emily, your daughter's 9?

472
00:28:29,088 --> 00:28:32,350
Yes. I want to preserve her innocence.

473
00:28:32,351 --> 00:28:34,423
I don't want her to be scared.

474
00:28:34,424 --> 00:28:36,344
Okay.

475
00:28:39,087 --> 00:28:41,441
This is creepy.

476
00:28:41,442 --> 00:28:43,112
What is?

477
00:28:43,113 --> 00:28:44,692
The thing that's in here.

478
00:28:44,693 --> 00:28:48,472
It makes me feel
uncomfortable and scared.

479
00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:52,673
It looked like... like a Grim Reaper.

480
00:28:53,378 --> 00:28:56,214
The classic image of
death is the Grim Reaper...

481
00:28:56,215 --> 00:28:59,516
A skeleton wearing a dark
cloak and carrying a sickle,

482
00:28:59,517 --> 00:29:02,982
but I know death looks
nothing like that.

483
00:29:02,983 --> 00:29:06,388
But I think it's, you know,
just a regular dead person.

484
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:11,996
So, when I saw a Reaper, I knew it was only
a projection meant to scare the living.

485
00:29:11,997 --> 00:29:15,409
And the person hiding
behind that illusion...

486
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:18,274
Was the greaser man.

487
00:29:18,275 --> 00:29:21,195
Now I'm picking up on his death state,

488
00:29:21,196 --> 00:29:25,209
and feeling everything that
he went through physically.

489
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,512
It's, like, really hurting my head.

490
00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:30,915
I just feel very, very sick.

491
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:32,667
You gonna be all right?

492
00:29:32,668 --> 00:29:35,319
I'm out of it. Like,
my equilibrium's off.

493
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,200
I'm... disoriented.

494
00:29:39,024 --> 00:29:42,144
It **** hurts, man.

495
00:29:43,028 --> 00:29:44,331
Next...

496
00:29:44,332 --> 00:29:46,429
I think the death is suspicious.

497
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,632
Steve follows a trail of tragedy.

498
00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:50,356
Were you surprised when
they found him dead?

499
00:29:50,357 --> 00:29:53,201
And what happened
after the investigation?

500
00:29:53,202 --> 00:29:57,042
I wasn't expecting that at all.

501
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:12,827
Emily and Jeff ran two
businesses out of their property.

502
00:30:12,828 --> 00:30:15,830
But before that, it was
just a residential home.

503
00:30:15,831 --> 00:30:18,341
My first move was to meet
with the former owner.

504
00:30:18,342 --> 00:30:22,369
Talking to her, it sounded like
anyone who spent time at that house...

505
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,950
Wound up dead.

506
00:30:32,881 --> 00:30:36,671
Cheryl, I got called in to
investigate your old home.

507
00:30:36,672 --> 00:30:39,149
- How long did you live there?
- About five years.

508
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:42,208
What did you use the garage
for, or was it always a garage?

509
00:30:42,209 --> 00:30:46,799
We did a lot of hangouts
with friends in there.

510
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,396
People came by every
day, and it was like...

511
00:30:51,397 --> 00:30:53,320
They lived there.

512
00:30:53,321 --> 00:30:55,084
People that are living
there now are claiming

513
00:30:55,085 --> 00:30:57,164
there's a lot of paranormal
activity going on.

514
00:30:57,165 --> 00:30:58,931
Did you ever experience
anything like that?

515
00:30:58,932 --> 00:31:01,368
We lost three of our dear
friends within a year.

516
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:02,983
- Really?
- Right.

517
00:31:02,984 --> 00:31:04,771
This is Kevin.

518
00:31:04,772 --> 00:31:09,342
Kevin was hit by a car on his
motorcycle, and he was killed instantly.

519
00:31:09,343 --> 00:31:13,613
And then we lost Tony. He
had a stroke and he died.

520
00:31:13,614 --> 00:31:17,750
And then we had Mark. He had previously
lived in the basement of that house.

521
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:19,342
And what did he die of?

522
00:31:19,343 --> 00:31:21,181
He had some problems and some issues,

523
00:31:21,182 --> 00:31:25,596
and he lived in an apartment complex that
had a lot of people that did drugs in it.

524
00:31:25,597 --> 00:31:29,137
Whatever he was doing, he just
looked worse every time I saw him.

525
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:33,278
He went to bed and didn't wake up.

526
00:31:34,441 --> 00:31:36,550
Were you surprised when
they found him dead?

527
00:31:36,551 --> 00:31:38,351
No.

528
00:31:43,377 --> 00:31:46,045
The greaser dude...

529
00:31:46,046 --> 00:31:51,086
He's tall, he's wearing a
black, like, '50s biker jacket.

530
00:31:51,087 --> 00:31:55,647
He killed himself when
he was intoxicated.

531
00:31:56,403 --> 00:32:00,167
Now that I knew how the man
had died, I was concerned.

532
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:04,054
He needed to leave that location,
and only I could help him.

533
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:08,391
Unfortunately, his temper was
the one thing getting in my way.

534
00:32:08,392 --> 00:32:11,812
He's mad and walked away.

535
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:19,593
He's not gonna talk to me again.

536
00:32:20,985 --> 00:32:22,978
At this point, I had three deaths that

537
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:25,742
were loosely connected
to Jeff and Emily's place.

538
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:28,910
But I wanted to know if anyone
had actually died on the property.

539
00:32:28,911 --> 00:32:30,818
A local journalist gave me just that...

540
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:33,357
A former owner who fell down the stairs.

541
00:32:33,358 --> 00:32:35,267
Her choice of a meeting spot was odd.

542
00:32:35,268 --> 00:32:40,728
But as soon as I got there,
I understood the meaning.

543
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:51,441
This is actually where
Helen Hillman is buried.

544
00:32:51,442 --> 00:32:54,797
She was married when she was 19 in 1917.

545
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:58,425
Then they moved from Arkansas to
right outside of Wichita, Kansas,

546
00:32:58,426 --> 00:33:00,482
on the property that
you're investigating.

547
00:33:00,483 --> 00:33:03,365
Now, what were you able to find out
about the circumstances of her death?

548
00:33:03,366 --> 00:33:08,660
Well, according to her death
certificate, it's a massive head injury.

549
00:33:08,661 --> 00:33:12,195
Even though she was 79, according to
her descendent, she was in good health.

550
00:33:12,196 --> 00:33:14,891
She was active, she lived independently.

551
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:16,727
All right, so it was
odd the way she died.

552
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:19,329
She had lived in that house for so long,

553
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,188
and the distance between
the stairs and the floor

554
00:33:22,189 --> 00:33:24,835
wouldn't be enough to
kill someone, typically.

555
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,387
I don't know if that fall
can cause injuries like that.

556
00:33:27,388 --> 00:33:32,788
Yes, and that's why I think
the death is suspicious.

557
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:36,382
There's another person.

558
00:33:36,383 --> 00:33:39,923
I think she broke her neck.

559
00:33:41,105 --> 00:33:45,722
Early to mid '70s...
that's when she died.

560
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:49,503
She was dead, like, fast.

561
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:56,517
God, it **** hurts.

562
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,344
When I do a sketch, the idea is to put
a face to one of the entities I saw.

563
00:34:08,345 --> 00:34:11,347
But sometimes I need to
take it to the next level.

564
00:34:11,348 --> 00:34:14,014
And in this case, I wanted
to show how one of the living

565
00:34:14,015 --> 00:34:16,853
was the source of that
property's problems.

566
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:21,954
I saw this woman at the
door, about to open it.

567
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,602
Behind her...

568
00:34:25,603 --> 00:34:29,023
Is this really tall man...

569
00:34:29,341 --> 00:34:33,721
And he is wearing, like, a black cloak.

570
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:42,215
Hey, Amy, is this what you saw?

571
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:45,779
Yes.

572
00:34:45,782 --> 00:34:47,342
Coming up next...

573
00:34:47,343 --> 00:34:48,382
He wants you out.

574
00:34:48,383 --> 00:34:50,821
Amy exposes a disturbing secret...

575
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:53,577
Is there a reason why
you're running from it?

576
00:34:53,578 --> 00:34:56,735
That changes the
clients' lives forever...

577
00:34:56,736 --> 00:34:59,237
For us, the final chapter
hasn't been written yet.

578
00:34:59,238 --> 00:35:01,298
All negativity must leave.

579
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:04,659
On "Dead Files Revisited".

580
00:35:26,513 --> 00:35:28,848
This is Emily and Jeff.

581
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:31,183
Jeff actually runs the garage here.

582
00:35:31,184 --> 00:35:34,186
Emily runs the salon up front.

583
00:35:34,187 --> 00:35:35,832
When I first met Amy,

584
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:39,199
I felt like she could look into my
soul when I looked into her eyes.

585
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,258
Her green eyes kind of just felt
like they looked right through you.

586
00:35:43,259 --> 00:35:49,031
When I started my walk, I came
into contact with this creepy male.

587
00:35:49,032 --> 00:35:54,672
His hair is greased back. He
hates anybody in his space.

588
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:00,049
When he gets upset, he likes to
yell, he likes to throw things.

589
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,894
Of all the deaths on that property,

590
00:36:01,895 --> 00:36:04,958
the guy Amy described
reminded me of Mark.

591
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:09,762
He actually lived in the
basement of your salon.

592
00:36:09,763 --> 00:36:12,164
And Jeff agreed with me.

593
00:36:12,165 --> 00:36:14,103
This guy look familiar at all?

594
00:36:14,104 --> 00:36:17,411
Yeah. I remember distinctly seeing this.

595
00:36:17,412 --> 00:36:20,797
When Steve took that out,
I connected with the eyes.

596
00:36:20,798 --> 00:36:24,083
He had the distinct
glare, looking down at us.

597
00:36:24,084 --> 00:36:26,980
I honestly thought that it
wasn't safe to stay here.

598
00:36:26,981 --> 00:36:30,599
Would he hurt me or somebody out
here or is he just trying to scare us?

599
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,270
No. He wants to hurt
you. He wants you out.

600
00:36:35,271 --> 00:36:37,606
So, what else did you see on your walk?

601
00:36:37,607 --> 00:36:40,558
A woman up in the attic area.

602
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:45,299
Her death was so fast
and extremely painful.

603
00:36:45,543 --> 00:36:50,103
And I did get that she died in the '70s.

604
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:54,674
There's a woman... Helen Hillman... who
lived in the house that your salon is in.

605
00:36:54,675 --> 00:36:57,380
1977 is when she died.

606
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:01,245
She fell down the
steps into the basement.

607
00:37:01,246 --> 00:37:03,043
Wow.

608
00:37:03,044 --> 00:37:07,052
That was really sad, knowing
that someone has died here.

609
00:37:07,053 --> 00:37:09,149
By falling down the staircase.

610
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:14,850
That's horrible to think of...
falling to your own death.

611
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,231
So, what else did you get on the walk?

612
00:37:17,232 --> 00:37:19,827
What I saw was...

613
00:37:19,828 --> 00:37:22,661
Your typical Grim Reaper.

614
00:37:22,662 --> 00:37:28,270
So, as I'm looking deeper, I can
feel and tell that it's a dead male...

615
00:37:28,271 --> 00:37:31,720
That he... hid in life a lot.

616
00:37:31,721 --> 00:37:34,875
And now he's hiding again in death.

617
00:37:34,876 --> 00:37:38,111
Basically, he wants to cause pain...

618
00:37:38,112 --> 00:37:40,447
And to hurt people.

619
00:37:40,448 --> 00:37:42,949
I could tell my findings
about the Grim Reaper

620
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:45,449
were definitely
startling Jeff and Emily.

621
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:50,319
Unfortunately, my most troubling
revelation was yet to come.

622
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,661
The other thing that
I saw was a sensitive...

623
00:37:54,662 --> 00:37:57,745
Who lets the dead into the main house.

624
00:37:57,746 --> 00:38:00,113
They just kind of follow her in.

625
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:03,894
This includes the Grim Reaper guy.

626
00:38:03,895 --> 00:38:05,671
I was ready for just...

627
00:38:05,672 --> 00:38:09,006
This is what happened, this is
the facts, this is what we saw.

628
00:38:09,007 --> 00:38:11,512
And bless the place, and it's over.

629
00:38:11,513 --> 00:38:14,180
And that's not what it was all about.

630
00:38:14,181 --> 00:38:17,684
Amy went deeper and found out more.

631
00:38:17,685 --> 00:38:20,902
I did do a sketch of what I saw...

632
00:38:20,903 --> 00:38:26,250
As far as this individual leading
several dead people into the house.

633
00:38:32,803 --> 00:38:35,203
Is that me?

634
00:38:39,322 --> 00:38:42,938
What kind of experiences have you had?

635
00:38:42,939 --> 00:38:44,979
A lot.

636
00:38:45,381 --> 00:38:47,288
It kind of took my breath away at first.

637
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:49,567
I've never shared this
with anyone before.

638
00:38:49,568 --> 00:38:51,303
It's not something
you really talk about.

639
00:38:51,304 --> 00:38:57,099
I didn't want to look upon
as being a freak or something.

640
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:02,020
Is there a reason why
you're running from it?

641
00:39:02,665 --> 00:39:07,604
It's something that, if you
run, they're gonna follow you.

642
00:39:07,605 --> 00:39:11,086
And it's hereditary.
It runs in families.

643
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:14,567
I see it with my daughter.

644
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:18,930
The most important question is,
is it gonna be safe for you guys,

645
00:39:18,931 --> 00:39:22,929
your employees, customers,
most importantly, your family?

646
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:26,453
The first thing is to take
care of the girl in the attic.

647
00:39:26,454 --> 00:39:30,365
Get some Sage and some salt. Go ahead
and Sage the building inside and out,

648
00:39:30,366 --> 00:39:32,692
then taking the salt...

649
00:39:32,693 --> 00:39:37,639
And drawing a line all around the
outside of the building, as well.

650
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,444
What about the Grim
Reaper and the greaser guy?

651
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:45,565
So, the greaser guy and the Grim
Reaper are actually the same person.

652
00:39:45,566 --> 00:39:49,167
Occasionally, I'll meet a dead person...

653
00:39:49,168 --> 00:39:52,468
That forms an attachment.

654
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,218
So...

655
00:39:55,219 --> 00:39:59,591
I'm going to go ahead
and take him home with me.

656
00:39:59,592 --> 00:40:03,332
I try not to make it a habit of
removing entities from a location.

657
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:06,619
But Jeff and Emily couldn't
handle that guy on their own.

658
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:10,168
He needed someone like
me to help him move on.

659
00:40:10,169 --> 00:40:13,206
You need to learn how to
control your environment

660
00:40:13,207 --> 00:40:16,213
and your daughter's environment so
she can protect herself, as well.

661
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:22,114
You gonna be alright doing this with your
daughter, you gonna be comfortable with it?

662
00:40:37,085 --> 00:40:38,486
The night after the reveal,

663
00:40:38,487 --> 00:40:43,407
we immediately went and
performed the cleansing.

664
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:46,365
Emily was definitely overwhelmed,

665
00:40:46,366 --> 00:40:50,130
knowing that she had the
power to remove these things.

666
00:40:50,131 --> 00:40:52,632
So, that's just a lot of weight
on a person's shoulders...

667
00:40:52,633 --> 00:40:56,390
To know that it's their
job to move these things on.

668
00:40:56,391 --> 00:41:00,040
All negativity must leave this location.

669
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:03,877
I was very concerned. I just didn't
want to put anyone in jeopardy.

670
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:09,278
I didn't want to cause
anyone fear or pain or hurt.

671
00:41:10,097 --> 00:41:14,264
It's very interesting, but since the
cleansing, we've had more activity.

672
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:17,821
Stuff moves, you hear
people whisper in your ears.

673
00:41:17,822 --> 00:41:20,136
It's very scary.

674
00:41:20,137 --> 00:41:25,717
As we saw things still
progress, we did more cleansings.

675
00:41:25,857 --> 00:41:31,757
We've done two more since then, and we're
working to continue to cleanse the house.

676
00:41:31,849 --> 00:41:34,992
I do feel the pressure that
I'm the one that needs to help

677
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:37,453
these spirits or these
entities pass over.

678
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:40,882
Only light, love, and peace
may enter this location.

679
00:41:40,883 --> 00:41:44,063
And that's very heavy.

680
00:41:46,784 --> 00:41:49,246
For us, the final chapter
hasn't been written yet.

681
00:41:49,247 --> 00:41:53,417
Emily's gonna have to learn
to work with these things.

682
00:41:53,418 --> 00:41:59,318
This is a lifelong process that she and my
daughter have to both be able to do this.

683
00:41:59,924 --> 00:42:03,164
No negativity may enter.

684
00:42:03,422 --> 00:42:09,322
And these cleansings are just
going to be a part of life now.

685
00:42:11,457 --> 00:42:14,007
I'm still concerned
about Jeff and Emily.

686
00:42:14,008 --> 00:42:18,179
Regular cleansings might eventually
help calm things down here,

687
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:21,632
but learning to control your
abilities is a lifelong struggle.

688
00:42:21,633 --> 00:42:25,713
And Emily's journey has just begun.
