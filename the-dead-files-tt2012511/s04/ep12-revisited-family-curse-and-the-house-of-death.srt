1
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,436
Tonight on "Dead Files Revisited"...

2
00:00:08,437 --> 00:00:10,471
He said that he'd
kill me if I came here.

3
00:00:10,472 --> 00:00:15,176
A second look at some of Amy and
Steve's most terrifying cases.

4
00:00:15,177 --> 00:00:17,090
You've got a lot of activity here.

5
00:00:17,091 --> 00:00:18,246
New information...

6
00:00:18,247 --> 00:00:20,281
Ashley's been too afraid to come back.

7
00:00:20,282 --> 00:00:21,983
Startling revelations...

8
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:24,420
I still feel like I'm being watched.

9
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:27,885
First, a return to
Belvidere, Illinois...

10
00:00:27,886 --> 00:00:30,421
Very concerned for
the welfare of my son.

11
00:00:30,422 --> 00:00:32,126
Where fighting evil...

12
00:00:32,127 --> 00:00:35,066
It'll torment the people
who are living here.

13
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:36,886
Means breaking the rules.

14
00:00:36,887 --> 00:00:39,004
I'll set it up.

15
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:41,970
Then, we travel back to
Clinton, North Carolina...

16
00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:44,212
House of death.

17
00:00:44,213 --> 00:00:45,944
Where the sins of the past...

18
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,262
There's dead bodies all over the place.

19
00:00:48,263 --> 00:00:50,378
Continue to curse the living.

20
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:52,354
This is a lot of pressure for you.

21
00:00:52,355 --> 00:00:53,982
Did they fight back...

22
00:00:53,983 --> 00:00:56,211
So you're gonna take
Amy's advice and do this?

23
00:00:56,212 --> 00:00:58,458
Or do they still live in fear?

24
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:02,719
I've never gone back there by myself.

25
00:01:03,592 --> 00:01:06,037
They're being watched.

26
00:01:06,038 --> 00:01:09,158
My name is Amy Allan.

27
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:11,410
This thing likes death.

28
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:12,910
I see dead people.

29
00:01:12,911 --> 00:01:14,552
This thing's, like, a monster.

30
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:16,815
I speak to dead people.

31
00:01:16,816 --> 00:01:18,350
And he's pissed off now.

32
00:01:18,351 --> 00:01:19,775
And they speak to me.

33
00:01:19,776 --> 00:01:21,287
His head was cracked.

34
00:01:21,288 --> 00:01:24,945
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

35
00:01:24,946 --> 00:01:26,224
This guy was murdered.

36
00:01:26,225 --> 00:01:27,978
I rely on my partner.

37
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:31,191
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

38
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:33,726
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

39
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:37,064
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

40
00:01:37,065 --> 00:01:38,498
You saw her?

41
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:39,781
It's my job to reveal them.

42
00:01:39,782 --> 00:01:41,056
Why would you stay here?

43
00:01:41,057 --> 00:01:43,236
But Steve and I never speak...

44
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:45,172
We never communicate
during an investigation.

45
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:46,539
Until the very end.

46
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,375
Stop it.

47
00:01:48,376 --> 00:01:50,278
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

48
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:52,846
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

49
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:54,147
Or time to get out.

50
00:01:54,148 --> 00:01:58,888
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

51
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:13,367
When I arrived in Belvidere, Illinois,

52
00:02:13,368 --> 00:02:15,710
I was expecting routine investigation.

53
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:18,011
We were looking into the
history of an old farmhouse,

54
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:22,020
and our client's paranormal
experiences ran three generations deep.

55
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:23,622
But as the truth unraveled,

56
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:29,127
Amy and I decided that the only way to
save this family was to break the rules.

57
00:02:29,128 --> 00:02:32,772
Judy, you sounded really
concerned on the phone and upset.

58
00:02:32,773 --> 00:02:35,298
- I mean, what's going on?
- Well, we're here at my dad's house.

59
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:37,917
About 10 years ago, my
son and I moved in here,

60
00:02:37,918 --> 00:02:42,342
and ever since, we've heard
noises, we've seen apparitions.

61
00:02:42,343 --> 00:02:45,137
And we've been physically touched.

62
00:02:45,138 --> 00:02:47,516
I wanted to get my son
out of that situation,

63
00:02:47,517 --> 00:02:51,279
so about three years ago, we
moved and it hasn't stopped.

64
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,415
I'm very, very concerned
for the welfare of my son.

65
00:02:54,416 --> 00:03:00,021
We were terrified as I sat there
and saw my child just scared...

66
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:04,326
Running into my room... "Mom,
did you see it? Is it real?"

67
00:03:04,327 --> 00:03:09,564
You don't know what to do, especially
when they're screaming bloody murder.

68
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,833
Well, you're a tough
woman. I give you credit.

69
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:14,354
I had to be.

70
00:03:27,783 --> 00:03:33,583
So, there's, like, some really
significant stuff going on here.

71
00:03:33,584 --> 00:03:39,456
While I was opening, there was like this
little boy, and he didn't have any eyes.

72
00:03:39,457 --> 00:03:43,200
Looks, like, Angelic, but he's...

73
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:45,541
He's dark.

74
00:03:46,905 --> 00:03:49,758
Before a walk, I do
what's called an opening.

75
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,382
This process can give me a preview of
what I'm going to see at a location.

76
00:03:54,383 --> 00:03:58,580
But nothing could have prepared me for
the demonic energy of that little boy.

77
00:03:58,581 --> 00:04:03,501
What the **** is
burrowing under the ground?

78
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:07,533
It's like some creepy...

79
00:04:07,534 --> 00:04:10,054
Thing, like...

80
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,699
What are you thinking?

81
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,920
I think that the burrowing
monster is this child...

82
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:24,961
And I think that it'll torment
the people who are living here.

83
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:29,371
Judy's Father had his
own creepy experiences,

84
00:04:29,372 --> 00:04:33,081
but nothing terrifying enough to drive
a tough guy like him out of his own home.

85
00:04:33,082 --> 00:04:34,480
Looking back on this case,

86
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:40,381
he should have listened to his daughter
and gotten the hell out of there.

87
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:46,738
Franco, I spoke with your daughter.

88
00:04:46,739 --> 00:04:49,208
She told me she was
getting physically touched,

89
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:51,777
pretty much traumatized by
everything that happened here.

90
00:04:51,778 --> 00:04:54,244
I was wondering if you ever
experienced anything here.

91
00:04:54,245 --> 00:04:56,576
I sure did.

92
00:04:56,577 --> 00:05:02,143
In the dining room, a figure
walked in, and he looked at me.

93
00:05:02,144 --> 00:05:06,148
And like he was
surprised, that I was here.

94
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:10,169
This was a real tall, slender man.

95
00:05:10,504 --> 00:05:14,490
Had this old jacket,
almost like a suit jacket.

96
00:05:14,491 --> 00:05:18,168
But again, from way back when.

97
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:20,029
Wow.

98
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,785
So, I hear this voice.

99
00:05:24,786 --> 00:05:28,969
It's really grumbly,
like gravelly, like...

100
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,572
- Hoarse.
- Can you describe him more?

101
00:05:31,573 --> 00:05:34,301
He's probably in his, like, late 30s.

102
00:05:34,302 --> 00:05:36,942
He's thin.

103
00:05:37,246 --> 00:05:40,072
- He's yelling at me.
- What is he yelling?

104
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:43,018
He told me that he'd
kill me if I came here.

105
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:46,850
In my line of work, I get death
threats from the dead all the time.

106
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:51,733
It's risky, but sometimes I
just have to call their bluff.

107
00:05:51,734 --> 00:05:54,957
And I said, "yeah? Bring it on".

108
00:05:54,958 --> 00:06:00,450
Now he's small and weak and
cowering, and he's crying.

109
00:06:00,451 --> 00:06:03,811
He's like sad, depressed.

110
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,642
Judy was the one who called us in,

111
00:06:07,643 --> 00:06:12,734
but her son Frankie was about to
become the focus of my investigation.

112
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,016
Hearing his experiences
for the first time,

113
00:06:15,017 --> 00:06:17,754
I could tell deep down that
this tough-looking teenager,

114
00:06:17,755 --> 00:06:21,415
was really just a scared kid.

115
00:06:26,497 --> 00:06:29,356
Frankie, I was talking to
your Mom earlier and...

116
00:06:29,357 --> 00:06:32,063
She basically told me you
had it rough growing up here.

117
00:06:32,064 --> 00:06:35,792
There was one time I looked up
from the porch at that window.

118
00:06:35,793 --> 00:06:39,153
And I seen this figure...

119
00:06:39,248 --> 00:06:41,510
Moving back and forth.

120
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:44,448
I could see the rope around its neck.

121
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:48,183
And its head just hanging to the side.

122
00:06:48,184 --> 00:06:50,618
When you see something like that,

123
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:55,239
it definitely sends
chills down your spine.

124
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,535
Since I've seen that man in the barn,
I've never gone back there by myself.

125
00:07:00,536 --> 00:07:03,238
So, it looked like
somebody that was hung.

126
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:05,159
Yeah.

127
00:07:10,105 --> 00:07:14,065
My head hurts so bad up here.

128
00:07:14,707 --> 00:07:18,427
This male... he killed himself.

129
00:07:22,118 --> 00:07:24,878
It happened here.

130
00:07:25,892 --> 00:07:29,612
There's something with a rope.

131
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:37,676
How old were you when
this is all going on?

132
00:07:37,677 --> 00:07:40,399
Around 9, 10 years old.

133
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,253
- How were you sleeping at night?
- I wasn't really sleeping good at all.

134
00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:48,409
For a few years straight,
I had the same dream...

135
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:52,350
Of this man standing in
the yard, watching me.

136
00:07:52,351 --> 00:07:55,292
I was able to tell Steve things that I

137
00:07:55,293 --> 00:07:58,537
haven't told anybody
and kept them to myself.

138
00:07:58,538 --> 00:08:02,623
It was a huge relief to be
able to tell him everything.

139
00:08:02,624 --> 00:08:04,192
Describe him to me.

140
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:06,679
Wasn't that tall. Had a mask on.

141
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,963
It was a plain white mask.

142
00:08:08,964 --> 00:08:11,654
Couldn't see his face, nothing.

143
00:08:11,655 --> 00:08:13,575
Okay.

144
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:19,895
Those things, they're
just all over here.

145
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:23,715
Probably seven feet tall, human-shaped.

146
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:25,719
Very broad.

147
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,827
Big arms.

148
00:08:27,828 --> 00:08:30,758
They were exchanging masks...

149
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:33,159
White masks.

150
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,172
Do you think living
people have seen these?

151
00:08:36,173 --> 00:08:38,608
Definitely, I think they've
like seen them and then like,

152
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:40,679
had like encounters with them.

153
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,361
And **** freaked the **** out.

154
00:08:43,362 --> 00:08:46,467
Because they are very scary.

155
00:08:46,468 --> 00:08:47,936
Next...

156
00:08:47,937 --> 00:08:49,470
I hear a gunshot.

157
00:08:49,471 --> 00:08:51,087
Death invades the barn.

158
00:08:51,088 --> 00:08:53,018
There's a lot of blood.

159
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:55,021
And in our second investigation...

160
00:08:55,022 --> 00:08:57,045
I don't want to be here by myself.

161
00:08:57,046 --> 00:08:58,945
Lives are changed forever.

162
00:08:58,946 --> 00:09:03,146
So I took matters into my own hands.

163
00:09:14,248 --> 00:09:18,451
Digging into the history of the
home, I got a hit on something big.

164
00:09:18,452 --> 00:09:20,953
Two brothers committed
suicide on the property.

165
00:09:20,954 --> 00:09:23,203
The newspaper details were slim,

166
00:09:23,204 --> 00:09:26,141
but now there was some merit
to what Frankie said he saw.

167
00:09:26,142 --> 00:09:32,042
But in order to get the full story,
I had to reach out to one of my own.

168
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:37,670
What were you able to find
out about these suicides?

169
00:09:37,671 --> 00:09:43,071
Back in 1939, Thomas Smith,
a 24-year-old young man.

170
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:45,626
Was having an argument
with his girlfriend...

171
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,364
Took a.22 caliber pistol...

172
00:09:48,365 --> 00:09:51,669
And shot himself in the heart.

173
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,076
Now what about the second suicide?

174
00:09:54,077 --> 00:09:56,777
Well, in 1961...

175
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:59,589
Thomas' brother Raymond...

176
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:05,490
Also committed suicide using the
exact same gun, but he doesn't die.

177
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,134
So he decides to hang himself.

178
00:10:08,135 --> 00:10:09,896
Have you ever heard
of anything like that?

179
00:10:09,897 --> 00:10:14,707
No. Of the 23 years, I never
had anything like this happen.

180
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:20,608
There was really no indication as to
why he would want to commit suicide.

181
00:10:24,351 --> 00:10:27,200
And there's the pain in my head.

182
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:29,704
Not everything I see
is always crystal-clear.

183
00:10:29,705 --> 00:10:33,475
It can be bits and pieces of
information that I have to put together.

184
00:10:33,476 --> 00:10:36,012
I think it's self-inflicted.

185
00:10:36,013 --> 00:10:37,461
What do you mean?

186
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:39,622
I saw...

187
00:10:39,732 --> 00:10:43,572
A noose, hanging from the beams.

188
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:47,556
There's a lot of blood.

189
00:10:47,557 --> 00:10:51,021
I hear somebody yelling.
I hear a male yelling.

190
00:10:51,022 --> 00:10:53,842
I hear a gunshot.

191
00:10:53,997 --> 00:10:55,780
From the information around me,

192
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:58,925
I was almost positive that
a man had hung himself.

193
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:02,600
But the fact that I also heard a
gunshot in the exact same spot...

194
00:11:02,601 --> 00:11:04,473
Didn't make sense.

195
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:06,881
Who's he that you're talking about?

196
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:10,362
The man who killed himself.

197
00:11:14,884 --> 00:11:17,947
I've investigated countless
deaths, and the fact that I

198
00:11:17,948 --> 00:11:21,637
couldn't find a motive for Raymond
Smith's suicide didn't sit right.

199
00:11:21,638 --> 00:11:27,538
And after talking to a descendant of
the Smith family, I wasn't any closer.

200
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:35,032
What can you tell me about Ed Sr.?

201
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:38,439
This is my great-grandfather.

202
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,444
I heard he was a
hardworking kind of man.

203
00:11:42,445 --> 00:11:46,259
The winters were harsh,
but he enjoyed doing it.

204
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,910
Because they knew they had
to provide for the family.

205
00:11:49,911 --> 00:11:53,501
I got to ask you a question... how
did these suicides affect your family?

206
00:11:53,502 --> 00:11:57,718
When Thomas committed suicide, they
were sad and they were heartbroken but,

207
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:59,640
they kind of saw it happening.

208
00:11:59,641 --> 00:12:03,477
But when Ray died,
nobody was expecting that.

209
00:12:03,478 --> 00:12:05,646
But it kind of erased the family.

210
00:12:05,647 --> 00:12:10,807
It kind of made them just
go all their own ways.

211
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:17,324
There's something about
this old man, grandpa...

212
00:12:17,325 --> 00:12:20,685
Like an Ed, Eddie, Edgar.

213
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,131
He's a farmer... literally
the image of a farmer...

214
00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:28,452
Overalls, cutoff sleeves, big, rosy guy.

215
00:12:29,645 --> 00:12:32,405
Anyways, he died.

216
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:35,309
While I was working out
the suicides that took place

217
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,012
in Franklin's house, I'd
gotten a frantic call from Judy.

218
00:12:38,013 --> 00:12:41,711
She said the activity in her
house was getting a lot worse.

219
00:12:41,712 --> 00:12:43,526
I had no choice.

220
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:47,311
I had to break the rules and
ask Amy to walk Judy's new home.

221
00:12:47,312 --> 00:12:50,492
Okay, I'll set it up.

222
00:13:04,712 --> 00:13:06,992
There's...

223
00:13:07,527 --> 00:13:11,067
People. They've been called.

224
00:13:11,235 --> 00:13:16,815
They've been asked to come
into the back of the house.

225
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:23,152
A walk requires an incredible
amount of my energy,

226
00:13:23,153 --> 00:13:24,885
and can wear me down for days.

227
00:13:24,886 --> 00:13:28,897
So doing a second walk that
soon took its toll on me.

228
00:13:28,898 --> 00:13:31,535
But it was the right thing
to do for our clients.

229
00:13:31,536 --> 00:13:33,333
My body doesn't feel comfortable here.

230
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:36,514
It's like, you know...

231
00:13:36,876 --> 00:13:39,696
This annoying hum.

232
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:44,402
I feel like there are two people
that have been having experiences.

233
00:13:44,403 --> 00:13:46,928
Is what's going on dangerous for them?

234
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:48,324
Yeah.

235
00:13:48,325 --> 00:13:52,345
They've had nasty **** come in.

236
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,505
Next...

237
00:13:53,506 --> 00:13:55,956
It's some kind of demonic presence.

238
00:13:55,957 --> 00:13:57,683
It's scary.

239
00:13:57,684 --> 00:14:00,027
What happened after the investigation.

240
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:02,119
I was really sweating bullets.

241
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,460
Our Father, who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name.

242
00:14:27,147 --> 00:14:31,451
Amy, I want to introduce you
to three generations here.

243
00:14:31,452 --> 00:14:34,629
When I was about to meet Amy,
I was really sweating bullets.

244
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,557
But I had to stay strong
for everybody else.

245
00:14:37,558 --> 00:14:41,154
Big concern here is, is
it safe for Franco to stay.

246
00:14:41,155 --> 00:14:45,261
And have Judy and Frankie taken
something back to where they live now,

247
00:14:45,262 --> 00:14:46,799
and are they gonna be okay?

248
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,500
So with that, Amy will start
and tell us about her walk.

249
00:14:53,913 --> 00:14:58,034
The first thing that
I got was this little...

250
00:14:58,035 --> 00:15:01,933
Creature, and, um, it would
burrow into the ground.

251
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:04,378
And it felt very, very negative.

252
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:09,818
And then I saw these Creature
things out in the yard.

253
00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:14,827
They were like seven feet tall,
abnormally long arms, muscular.

254
00:15:14,828 --> 00:15:18,068
They were wearing masks.

255
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:24,410
When I was a little kid,
I would go to bed...

256
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:29,667
And in the dream, I would see just one
man standing there, wouldn't do nothing.

257
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:34,146
He had a mask on, and I would
have that dream constantly.

258
00:15:34,147 --> 00:15:36,949
My God. My God.

259
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:40,104
Okay, all right, I drew it.

260
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:44,706
To help describe what I see during
my walk, I bring in a sketch artist.

261
00:15:44,707 --> 00:15:50,607
It's an important way to validate my
findings with Steve and our clients.

262
00:15:53,448 --> 00:15:55,308
Wow.

263
00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:08,493
Well, I think I'd be afraid if I saw
that in the middle of the night, too.

264
00:16:08,494 --> 00:16:12,054
The sketch... that was really trippy.

265
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:15,720
It scared me because
just seeing it again...

266
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:20,266
All those years of haunting me and then
all of a sudden seeing it in reality,

267
00:16:20,267 --> 00:16:25,188
that definitely, definitely
sent chills down my spine.

268
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:27,829
Yeah, that's...

269
00:16:28,049 --> 00:16:30,689
Looks like him.

270
00:16:31,682 --> 00:16:33,783
It's scary.

271
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:39,556
Frankie never got into detail of what
it was that he was seeing or dreaming of.

272
00:16:39,557 --> 00:16:42,678
When I saw that sketch,
I think it finally hit me.

273
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:45,528
It wasn't a dream
anymore. It was real life.

274
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:47,300
Okay, Amy, what else did you see?

275
00:16:47,301 --> 00:16:49,833
I saw this farmer.

276
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:52,458
He lived here. I know he died here.

277
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:57,295
He comes in the barn a lot,
and his name was Ed or Eddie.

278
00:16:57,296 --> 00:16:59,174
You're kidding.

279
00:16:59,175 --> 00:17:00,744
Ed or Eddie?

280
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:06,351
The guy that I saw in the
house was very tall, lean...

281
00:17:06,352 --> 00:17:10,259
Very old-fashionedly dressed.

282
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,960
The original settler on this land,

283
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:14,633
was a second-generation farmer
by the name of Eddie Smith.

284
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:19,554
And he farmed this land
for probably 70 years.

285
00:17:21,497 --> 00:17:25,757
Now that looks more like what I seen.

286
00:17:26,802 --> 00:17:30,807
He looked just like that.
I seen him with my own eyes.

287
00:17:30,808 --> 00:17:32,672
That's incredible.

288
00:17:32,673 --> 00:17:35,852
I'm amazed every time our
findings connect like that.

289
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:38,845
But what Amy said
next just blew me away.

290
00:17:38,846 --> 00:17:42,318
The other person that I saw
was right here in this barn.

291
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,718
He, like, was suicidal.

292
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:48,688
I saw an old pistol, and
then I heard a gunshot.

293
00:17:48,689 --> 00:17:54,569
But I'm looking at these, and
I'm like, "he hung himself".

294
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,371
She almost nailed this down to 100%.

295
00:17:59,372 --> 00:18:03,036
His son Raymond in 1961
committed suicide in this barn.

296
00:18:03,037 --> 00:18:04,881
My God.

297
00:18:04,882 --> 00:18:07,756
Apparently he didn't die right away...

298
00:18:07,757 --> 00:18:11,184
- My God.
- So he took a rope and then hung himself.

299
00:18:11,185 --> 00:18:15,085
Tell Amy what you saw that time.

300
00:18:15,513 --> 00:18:19,972
I look up at the barn, and
I notice this white figure...

301
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:23,700
Peeking its head through the window,
but at the same time trying to hide,

302
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:26,301
like he didn't want us
to know he was there.

303
00:18:26,302 --> 00:18:31,276
It really did frighten me to know that
the man in the barn was actually real.

304
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:37,177
I've never looked at the barn
ever since that in the same way.

305
00:18:37,844 --> 00:18:43,022
The other thing that I saw was
a child, a 5-year-old little boy.

306
00:18:43,023 --> 00:18:46,303
The child is not a child.

307
00:18:46,304 --> 00:18:49,870
It's some kind of demonic presence.

308
00:18:49,871 --> 00:18:55,621
And what it did to this family
was it caused two suicides.

309
00:18:55,622 --> 00:19:00,035
It probably influenced
them to do it and...

310
00:19:00,036 --> 00:19:03,002
Completely destroyed the family.

311
00:19:03,003 --> 00:19:05,385
My absolute worst fear was,

312
00:19:05,386 --> 00:19:11,286
that she was gonna discover something
is malevolent, is a Demon, and she did.

313
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,334
Well, there's obviously
a lot going on here.

314
00:19:16,335 --> 00:19:18,119
Two biggest questions...

315
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,002
Is it safe for Franco at this house.

316
00:19:21,003 --> 00:19:25,617
And did this thing follow you two guys
to your new home, and are you safe there?

317
00:19:25,618 --> 00:19:28,734
In your house, you guys are
getting an influx of random

318
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:33,112
people and things coming in the
back door and the back window.

319
00:19:33,113 --> 00:19:37,786
But all you need to do
is bring in a holy man...

320
00:19:37,787 --> 00:19:41,184
Who will have a blessing
done and a sealing done.

321
00:19:41,185 --> 00:19:42,366
Okay.

322
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:46,545
But this property, your situation
is a little bit different.

323
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:50,994
You know, this thing's been here for
a long time, it can affect people.

324
00:19:50,995 --> 00:19:54,408
So you really need to
not only get the blessing,

325
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:57,109
but also you need to bring in a Shaman.

326
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:03,010
Who will seal up the property so that
the demonic thing can't get back in.

327
00:20:04,531 --> 00:20:08,666
My concern is that if you don't
take care of this, what could happen?

328
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,799
It'd be bad.

329
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,440
It'll continue.

330
00:20:13,605 --> 00:20:18,645
So you're gonna take
Amy's advice and do this?

331
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:35,460
When Amy said what had to be
done, I knew we had to take action.

332
00:20:37,551 --> 00:20:41,376
Get it done the right
way, get it done quick.

333
00:20:41,377 --> 00:20:44,903
Our Father, who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name.

334
00:20:44,904 --> 00:20:48,281
The priest came into the
property and blessed our house.

335
00:20:48,282 --> 00:20:53,813
By the power of God, cast into
hell Satan and all evil spirits.

336
00:20:53,814 --> 00:20:55,938
May this blessing
remain upon this house,

337
00:20:55,939 --> 00:21:01,378
and upon all those who live
here now and forever, amen.

338
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:07,196
The priest also left us with some
Bible verses that we need to recite.

339
00:21:07,197 --> 00:21:12,477
I do it every night to
continue to bless the home.

340
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:16,773
There are moments that I still
feel like I'm being watched.

341
00:21:16,774 --> 00:21:20,606
Occasionally, I will see something
out of the corner of my eye.

342
00:21:20,607 --> 00:21:25,280
When you see something like that, it
definitely makes your hair stand up.

343
00:21:25,281 --> 00:21:28,000
I don't think the activity
will ever end for good,

344
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:33,041
and my worry for my son
will never end, either.

345
00:21:34,987 --> 00:21:39,024
The problem is my Father hasn't
done anything to his home yet.

346
00:21:39,025 --> 00:21:44,292
But we're hopeful that he will follow Amy's
advice, because the activity has subsided,

347
00:21:44,293 --> 00:21:47,473
but it hasn't stopped.

348
00:21:48,301 --> 00:21:52,301
Now that Judy and Frankie have blessed
their home, the dead should stay away.

349
00:21:52,302 --> 00:21:57,375
At least for the time being, but
Franco's home is another story.

350
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,338
Until the property is sealed,
I believe that the demon

351
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:06,239
will be waiting for the right
moment to tear this family apart.

352
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,130
When I got the call from Kara,

353
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:25,516
the Director of the Sampson Arts Council in
Clinton, North Carolina, she was desperate.

354
00:22:25,517 --> 00:22:27,729
Word had gotten out that
the place was haunted,

355
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,910
and her staff and students were
terrified to even go into the building.

356
00:22:31,911 --> 00:22:35,491
And after what Amy and I revealed
about what was really going on there...

357
00:22:35,492 --> 00:22:39,074
I don't blame them for being scared.

358
00:22:39,075 --> 00:22:41,453
Well, Kara, tell me what's going on.

359
00:22:41,454 --> 00:22:46,401
We've been having some experiences
here with volunteers hearing noises...

360
00:22:46,402 --> 00:22:50,462
Feeling something touch
them, and seeing apparitions.

361
00:22:50,463 --> 00:22:52,498
Let me ask you, what's
your biggest concern?

362
00:22:52,499 --> 00:22:55,742
We have a lot of kids who
come to take art classes,

363
00:22:55,743 --> 00:22:58,367
but their parents are
afraid to bring them up here.

364
00:22:58,368 --> 00:23:00,405
Because of the things that are going on.

365
00:23:00,406 --> 00:23:03,234
We might close down because of that.

366
00:23:03,235 --> 00:23:06,217
Not only were we in jeopardy
of losing volunteers,

367
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,538
but, also, losing the
community's support.

368
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:13,325
The Small House is the center
of our community for the arts.

369
00:23:13,326 --> 00:23:19,091
And if we had to leave this location,
it would just be devastating.

370
00:23:19,092 --> 00:23:21,827
Do you know who lived here before
the house became the art center?

371
00:23:21,828 --> 00:23:26,832
Well, Dr. Small was a general
practitioner here in Clinton.

372
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:29,731
He left the house in his
will to the arts council,

373
00:23:29,732 --> 00:23:32,143
in hopes that it would
be used for arts purposes.

374
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:37,371
And we're just here to
fulfill that dream for him.

375
00:23:37,372 --> 00:23:40,525
Would you stay overnight here alone?

376
00:23:40,526 --> 00:23:42,480
Probably not.

377
00:23:42,481 --> 00:23:48,381
Not too comfortable with this
house at night when it's dark.

378
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:07,302
There's, like, a lot of sadness.

379
00:24:08,841 --> 00:24:11,599
There was an overwhelming amount
of negativity in that house,

380
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,850
which is never good.

381
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:18,332
And the first entity who approached me
had a warning that made my skin crawl.

382
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:21,171
There's a woman...

383
00:24:21,172 --> 00:24:24,052
And she's talking.

384
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:32,120
The first thing she said when
she came up was "house of death".

385
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:35,347
Next...

386
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,936
- So, what were they doing?
- A **** Séance.

387
00:24:37,937 --> 00:24:40,405
Amy uncovers the startling truth.

388
00:24:40,406 --> 00:24:44,546
The dead begin to resent the living.

389
00:24:55,628 --> 00:25:00,186
Amy and I were investigating the
Sampson Arts Council in North Carolina.

390
00:25:00,187 --> 00:25:03,539
The center's Director had serious
concerns that paranormal activity,

391
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,935
was driving away her staff and students.

392
00:25:06,936 --> 00:25:09,374
So, Kara, why did you
bring me in this room?

393
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:13,838
To show you the photos of Dr.
Small and his wife, Suzanne.

394
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:18,452
The legend is if you were to switch the
photos and hang them facing each other...

395
00:25:18,453 --> 00:25:23,673
Dr. Small comes and gently
places it on the floor.

396
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:27,061
Okay, now, why would he want
'em facing the other way, though?

397
00:25:27,062 --> 00:25:30,463
Dr. Small and his wife didn't
get along, and he said...

398
00:25:30,464 --> 00:25:34,631
"I don't want to look at Suzanne
for the rest of eternity".

399
00:25:34,632 --> 00:25:36,961
During the daytime, I
feel comfortable here,

400
00:25:36,962 --> 00:25:41,015
but at night, when it gets dark,
I don't want to be here by myself.

401
00:25:41,016 --> 00:25:46,916
This house just has a feeling about
it, like Dr. Small is lurking around.

402
00:25:47,757 --> 00:25:50,753
Sounds like you've got a lot of activity
here, from what you're telling me.

403
00:25:50,754 --> 00:25:54,355
We've had a couple of other
groups to come in and investigate.

404
00:25:54,356 --> 00:25:56,721
- What do you mean, like Ghost Hunters?
- Yeah.

405
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:59,550
They've tried to talk with the dead but,

406
00:25:59,551 --> 00:26:02,786
we haven't really had
much result from them.

407
00:26:02,787 --> 00:26:03,969
Okay.

408
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:07,173
We weren't the first ones Kara
called in to help with their problems,

409
00:26:07,174 --> 00:26:11,014
but we were definitely the last.

410
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:13,116
There's a round table.

411
00:26:13,117 --> 00:26:16,477
People are sitting around.

412
00:26:17,434 --> 00:26:20,317
So, what were they doing?

413
00:26:20,318 --> 00:26:22,481
A **** Séance.

414
00:26:22,482 --> 00:26:24,548
They're holding hands...

415
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:29,803
"Is anybody here? Can we talk to
anybody? Why are you doing these things?"

416
00:26:29,804 --> 00:26:34,161
I was so angry. It was bad enough that
the house was full of dead people...

417
00:26:34,162 --> 00:26:37,323
But to bring in a bunch of thrill
seekers to try and clear them out,

418
00:26:37,324 --> 00:26:39,566
only made things worse.

419
00:26:39,567 --> 00:26:43,187
So how would a séance
affect the dead here?

420
00:26:43,188 --> 00:26:46,432
The dead begin to resent the living.

421
00:26:46,433 --> 00:26:52,333
How would you like it if people kept
coming in your home and **** with you?

422
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,707
Next, I met with a former employee.

423
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:02,178
So far, she was the only witness
that had actually seen something.

424
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:08,079
And after we spoke, I started to get a
pretty good idea of who I needed to find.

425
00:27:12,222 --> 00:27:14,823
Meredith, I understand
you had some experiences.

426
00:27:14,824 --> 00:27:18,819
When I was maybe 5 or 6,
I was here for a party.

427
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,188
And a figure came from
that door over there,

428
00:27:22,189 --> 00:27:25,668
and walked through the
railing and down the stairway.

429
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:28,037
- You mean like an apparition?
- Yes.

430
00:27:28,038 --> 00:27:30,739
It was a man, maybe 40s or 50s.

431
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,568
What about now, how are
you feeling being here now?

432
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:37,949
There's no way I'd be here by myself.

433
00:27:40,212 --> 00:27:45,288
There's like this guy who's really
depressed, and he wears a dark suit.

434
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,306
He's kind of tall.

435
00:27:47,307 --> 00:27:51,254
I think that he's been seen,
and I think that he's been heard.

436
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:54,121
When I first saw that
depressed man, I thought...

437
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:57,955
"Maybe he could help me figure
out what happened in the house".

438
00:27:57,956 --> 00:28:03,856
But the moment he started speaking, I knew
that help was the last thing on his mind.

439
00:28:08,245 --> 00:28:11,425
- You all right?
- No.

440
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:17,360
This man is, like, preaching,
and it's, like, really disturbing.

441
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:20,389
Like he's getting off on death.

442
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:25,010
People are, like,
freaking the **** out.

443
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:29,799
At this point, it was clear a
lot was happening in the house.

444
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,532
But it wasn't till I spoke to one of the
center's current volunteers that I realized

445
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:39,433
what kind of impact the building was
having on people's health and their sanity.

446
00:28:44,147 --> 00:28:47,783
So, Ashley, I was wondering if you
ever had any strange experiences here.

447
00:28:47,784 --> 00:28:52,461
Um yes, the bathroom right
up here I won't go in at all.

448
00:28:52,462 --> 00:28:55,023
- Why?
- Whenever I go in there, I get chills.

449
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:58,937
- It makes me physically sick.
- All right, you know what? Come with me.

450
00:28:58,938 --> 00:29:01,812
I know you're scared, but just come
with me for a second, all right?

451
00:29:01,813 --> 00:29:04,430
Okay. How are you feeling?

452
00:29:04,431 --> 00:29:08,523
Just seeing it this close
is getting me a little upset.

453
00:29:08,524 --> 00:29:10,509
You're really shaking.

454
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:14,143
- You all right?
- Just uneasy being near this bathroom.

455
00:29:14,144 --> 00:29:17,110
All right, come on.
Let's go back out here.

456
00:29:17,111 --> 00:29:20,538
Can you describe what you
physically just went through?

457
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:25,518
Shaky, trembly, it's a feeling
that I don't ever want to feel ever.

458
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:28,391
Would you stay overnight in any
other part of the house here?

459
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,972
Absolutely not.

460
00:29:33,018 --> 00:29:34,031
Next...

461
00:29:34,032 --> 00:29:35,831
Is anything unusual in this will?

462
00:29:35,832 --> 00:29:37,700
The bodies start stacking up.

463
00:29:37,701 --> 00:29:40,135
Sliced his throat right at the jugular.

464
00:29:40,136 --> 00:29:42,705
And what happened
after the investigation?

465
00:29:42,706 --> 00:29:46,006
I had an uneasy feeling.

466
00:29:58,118 --> 00:30:00,089
The Sampson Arts Council got started,

467
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,055
when a local Doctor donated his
home to the County in his will.

468
00:30:03,056 --> 00:30:06,579
By most accounts, Dr. Small
seemed like a decent guy.

469
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,924
But after talking to the
lawyer who drew up his will,

470
00:30:08,925 --> 00:30:14,825
I got the impression that the Doctor
might have been hiding a few secrets.

471
00:30:19,475 --> 00:30:22,429
Dr. Small... what can
you tell me about him?

472
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,715
Dr. Small...

473
00:30:24,716 --> 00:30:27,571
Certainly was a unique personality...

474
00:30:27,572 --> 00:30:28,714
To say the least.

475
00:30:28,715 --> 00:30:33,107
I think he was eccentric,
in some respects.

476
00:30:33,108 --> 00:30:35,053
So, Gene, you actually wrote his will?

477
00:30:35,054 --> 00:30:39,101
Yes, I did. I have a copy of it here.

478
00:30:39,102 --> 00:30:41,193
Is anything unusual in this will?

479
00:30:41,194 --> 00:30:44,100
Well, he didn't provide for his wife.

480
00:30:44,101 --> 00:30:47,882
I do recall that... I think
they slept in separate bedrooms.

481
00:30:47,883 --> 00:30:50,819
As I understand, they had
separate bank accounts.

482
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,816
And when he would talk, it was
always in first person singular.

483
00:30:54,817 --> 00:30:58,117
He would never say "we".

484
00:31:02,081 --> 00:31:05,083
It's like... I want to
say, like, there's a Doctor.

485
00:31:05,084 --> 00:31:09,284
Like, he knows a lot about the body.

486
00:31:09,676 --> 00:31:12,224
And, like, pressure points.

487
00:31:12,225 --> 00:31:15,877
You feel the pressure, and
then you'll feel, like...

488
00:31:15,878 --> 00:31:20,786
Like you want to pass out or whatever,
because he's pushing these points.

489
00:31:20,787 --> 00:31:24,828
I could see that the Doctor had
learned many techniques to cause pain.

490
00:31:24,829 --> 00:31:28,429
And at night, when he could
hide under the cover of darkness,

491
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:33,546
he enjoyed using those
skills to torture the living.

492
00:31:33,547 --> 00:31:37,319
He knows where to touch, like the
spots to make headaches come on,

493
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:42,120
to make people feel
like they can't breathe.

494
00:31:42,214 --> 00:31:45,634
I don't like him at all.

495
00:31:49,229 --> 00:31:51,582
Dr. Small told Gene
that the guy who owned

496
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:54,213
the house in the early
1900s had killed himself.

497
00:31:54,214 --> 00:31:57,436
In those days, public records
of suicide were scarce.

498
00:31:57,437 --> 00:32:03,337
Fortunately, a local reporter was able to
help me track down the gruesome details.

499
00:32:07,146 --> 00:32:10,896
Dr. Leeman Matthews was our
Superintendent of Public Schools,

500
00:32:10,897 --> 00:32:15,388
here in Samson County
from 1907 until 1918.

501
00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:17,171
What about the suicide?

502
00:32:17,172 --> 00:32:20,712
It was, probably very messy.

503
00:32:21,057 --> 00:32:23,771
According to the death certificate...

504
00:32:23,772 --> 00:32:29,028
He had locked himself in the
bathroom upstairs, in the bathtub...

505
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:32,638
And sliced his throat,
right at the jugular.

506
00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:34,410
Okay.

507
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,579
Jeff, did he have a
history of depression?

508
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,003
Not that we've been able
to find any evidence of.

509
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:43,924
It just seemed to all
come across very sudden.

510
00:32:45,752 --> 00:32:50,222
You know what's weird is there's
dead bodies like all over the place?

511
00:32:50,223 --> 00:32:52,068
What do you mean? Can you describe them?

512
00:32:52,069 --> 00:32:57,709
They're just dead people,
laying around in random places.

513
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,520
The darkness is just very bad here.

514
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:09,521
There's this male lurking
in the dark who can hurt you.

515
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:16,370
He lives in the dark, and
he **** with people.

516
00:33:17,317 --> 00:33:19,764
I already had two deaths
tied to The Small House.

517
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:22,026
And after sitting down
with another historian,

518
00:33:22,027 --> 00:33:24,565
it seemed like everyone who
lived there died tragically.

519
00:33:24,566 --> 00:33:25,914
By the end of that interview,

520
00:33:25,915 --> 00:33:31,375
I was determined to make
sure it didn't happen again.

521
00:33:35,168 --> 00:33:40,506
Abraham Hobbs was born into a well-to-do
family in northern Sampson County.

522
00:33:40,507 --> 00:33:43,915
Abraham joined the
Confederate Army in 1862.

523
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:48,413
And just after the end of the war, he
went on to become a gentleman farmer.

524
00:33:48,414 --> 00:33:51,383
What about family? Did he have
wife, kids? What's the story?

525
00:33:51,384 --> 00:33:53,563
Abraham and his wife had six children.

526
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:57,497
And the focus of the house would
likely have been on the children,

527
00:33:57,498 --> 00:34:01,059
the gospel, faith, and their education.

528
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,496
- So he was a religious man?
- That's right.

529
00:34:03,497 --> 00:34:05,533
Who died on the property?
Do you have any idea?

530
00:34:05,534 --> 00:34:09,282
We know that one of his
daughters died in the 1880s.

531
00:34:09,283 --> 00:34:13,063
His wife, Lizzie, died in 1897.

532
00:34:13,172 --> 00:34:18,272
And his half-brother died
in the house, as well.

533
00:34:20,043 --> 00:34:24,717
This depressed man... he
owned this place for sure.

534
00:34:24,718 --> 00:34:29,338
He was preaching, and
he's, like, yelling.

535
00:34:29,491 --> 00:34:33,947
He had a room that was dark and small...

536
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:39,168
And that he would do things
to human bodies there.

537
00:34:40,957 --> 00:34:46,477
I think he was interested
in, like, what morticians do.

538
00:34:46,537 --> 00:34:49,542
I think this guy was
really fixated on death.

539
00:34:49,543 --> 00:34:51,710
I don't like him.

540
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:53,045
Coming up...

541
00:34:53,046 --> 00:34:55,452
I don't really think it's safe here.

542
00:34:55,453 --> 00:34:56,415
Wow.

543
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:57,850
Secrets come to light...

544
00:34:57,851 --> 00:34:59,655
This is a lot of pressure for you.

545
00:34:59,656 --> 00:35:00,719
And the living...

546
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,487
I would like to know...

547
00:35:02,488 --> 00:35:03,622
Confront the dead.

548
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:05,691
What it will take for you to leave.

549
00:35:05,692 --> 00:35:09,412
Next on "Dead Files Revisited".

550
00:35:31,281 --> 00:35:36,991
This is Kara. She is the Executive Director
of the Sampson County arts council.

551
00:35:36,992 --> 00:35:39,130
Going into the reveal...

552
00:35:39,131 --> 00:35:42,435
I had an uneasy feeling about
what was about to happen.

553
00:35:42,436 --> 00:35:44,601
We hadn't had any contact with Amy,

554
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:49,196
so the buildup about what
she saw was overwhelming.

555
00:35:49,197 --> 00:35:53,623
Kara's worried about possibly
having to shut the place down.

556
00:35:53,624 --> 00:35:57,098
Meredith used to volunteer here.
She doesn't do it any longer.

557
00:35:57,099 --> 00:35:59,300
Ashley does volunteer here.

558
00:35:59,301 --> 00:36:01,769
She doesn't even want to
be in this house alone.

559
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:07,267
So, Amy, why don't we start out
by you talking about your walk?

560
00:36:07,268 --> 00:36:11,506
I encountered this one entity who um...

561
00:36:11,507 --> 00:36:13,883
Knows, like, pressure points.

562
00:36:13,884 --> 00:36:17,484
So I thought he's a Doctor.

563
00:36:18,678 --> 00:36:20,355
It's funny you mention Doctor,

564
00:36:20,356 --> 00:36:24,871
because one of the previous
owners was a Dr. Small.

565
00:36:24,872 --> 00:36:30,772
I mean, he was considered a nice guy,
a gentle guy, but he hated his wife.

566
00:36:31,133 --> 00:36:35,364
It was just amazing to
me that Amy saw Dr. Small.

567
00:36:35,365 --> 00:36:39,674
And that it matched the
history that we have here.

568
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:43,492
And then what Amy said was frightening.

569
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:49,350
I don't really think it's safe
here at night because of him.

570
00:36:49,351 --> 00:36:52,591
That's when he attacks.

571
00:36:55,257 --> 00:36:56,624
Okay, what else?

572
00:36:56,625 --> 00:37:01,245
So I was upstairs,
and I saw dead bodies.

573
00:37:01,281 --> 00:37:03,724
So you're talking about the top
of the stairs by the bathroom.

574
00:37:03,725 --> 00:37:05,751
It was in front of the bathroom.

575
00:37:05,752 --> 00:37:08,280
This is a good time for
Ashley to tell you about

576
00:37:08,281 --> 00:37:11,238
how she gets when she
goes near that bathroom.

577
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:13,493
The first time I walked in the bathroom,

578
00:37:13,494 --> 00:37:17,878
I took two steps in and
got shaky, stomach hurts.

579
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:20,706
It feels like, you know,
a true feeling of dread.

580
00:37:20,707 --> 00:37:22,660
I'm getting shaky talking
about it right now.

581
00:37:22,661 --> 00:37:24,864
There was a guy that used to
live here before Dr. Small,

582
00:37:24,865 --> 00:37:27,455
by the name of Leeman Matthews.

583
00:37:27,456 --> 00:37:29,780
Never had issues.

584
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:33,001
He took a straight razor
and cut his jugular open,

585
00:37:33,002 --> 00:37:36,431
and bled to death in the bathtub.

586
00:37:36,432 --> 00:37:39,222
How do you feel about that
now that you know that?

587
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:41,088
It's a little shocking.

588
00:37:41,089 --> 00:37:44,381
I feel like Ashley felt
a sense of relief...

589
00:37:44,382 --> 00:37:49,571
In that Amy felt the same way when
she went into the bathroom upstairs.

590
00:37:49,572 --> 00:37:54,382
But she also felt more
afraid in that it was real.

591
00:37:54,383 --> 00:37:56,973
Okay, let's continue with
the rest of your walk.

592
00:37:56,974 --> 00:38:02,874
One of the people that I did come into
contact with was a very depressed man.

593
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:08,945
Very, very sad about the war,
and he was also preaching a lot.

594
00:38:08,946 --> 00:38:12,230
He would go into, like, rants.

595
00:38:12,231 --> 00:38:16,071
I saw a figure walk out of the room...

596
00:38:16,072 --> 00:38:20,199
Walk towards the stairway, through
the banister and down the stairs.

597
00:38:21,836 --> 00:38:26,188
Well, one of the original owners of
this place was a guy named Abraham Hobbs.

598
00:38:26,189 --> 00:38:28,629
He was a Confederate soldier.
The thing about Hobbs...

599
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:34,010
He was pretty religious and
very involved in the church here.

600
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:36,266
The depressed man that I saw...

601
00:38:36,267 --> 00:38:41,868
He was the one who would put
the dead people around the house.

602
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:47,715
And he's the one who's responsible for
turning the house into the house of death.

603
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:51,164
And I'm getting concerned about
what might have happened here...

604
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:53,839
- Okay.
- Or is happening here.

605
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:58,488
I was really concerned when Amy said
that it was dangerous for us to be here.

606
00:38:58,489 --> 00:39:04,009
You know, just wondering
about, would we have to leave?

607
00:39:04,081 --> 00:39:07,714
The most pressing question
is, Kara, is it safe...

608
00:39:07,715 --> 00:39:09,890
For you to keep this place open?

609
00:39:09,891 --> 00:39:13,077
For that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

610
00:39:13,078 --> 00:39:17,277
The first thing is to contact what
I like to call a living medium.

611
00:39:17,278 --> 00:39:21,547
Which is someone who connects
the living with the dead.

612
00:39:21,548 --> 00:39:25,925
They're going to connect Dr.
Small hopefully with his lawyer,

613
00:39:25,926 --> 00:39:28,852
who can be his representative still.

614
00:39:28,853 --> 00:39:31,373
Then Leeman...

615
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:38,313
The best thing there would be the
same type of scenario with you.

616
00:39:38,362 --> 00:39:41,724
Then contact a death medium, like me,

617
00:39:41,725 --> 00:39:46,655
who can come in and do a cleansing
from top to bottom, inside and out.

618
00:39:46,656 --> 00:39:52,342
If this is done properly, it should get
rid of all the entities that are here.

619
00:39:52,343 --> 00:39:55,628
Listen, are you okay? This
is a lot of pressure for you.

620
00:39:55,629 --> 00:39:58,708
I'm a little overwhelmed.
I'm not gonna lie.

621
00:39:58,709 --> 00:40:03,179
If you do do this, and you're strong
enough to do it, kids could come back.

622
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,108
Now, are you gonna be able to
follow through with all this,

623
00:40:06,109 --> 00:40:09,349
and help out with this?

624
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,497
Since the investigation,

625
00:40:23,498 --> 00:40:27,021
Ashley's been too afraid to
come back to The Small House,

626
00:40:27,022 --> 00:40:32,362
and to be a part of the
cleansing with the mediums.

627
00:40:32,874 --> 00:40:35,777
So I took matters into my own hands.

628
00:40:35,778 --> 00:40:37,812
I brought in two mediums...

629
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:42,817
I ask for insight and guidance
and clarity as to why you're here.

630
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:48,398
And Mr. Gene Thompson to
hopefully release the spirits...

631
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,992
And cleanse the building.

632
00:40:51,993 --> 00:40:55,684
On just a regular day, I'm
afraid to be here at night.

633
00:40:55,685 --> 00:40:59,346
But to know that I had to come
back and communicate with the dead,

634
00:40:59,347 --> 00:41:02,306
was just totally frightening.

635
00:41:02,307 --> 00:41:06,747
I would like to know why you're here...

636
00:41:06,775 --> 00:41:10,155
And what it would take for
you to be free to leave.

637
00:41:10,156 --> 00:41:15,883
But I had a sense of relief as
she went through her processes.

638
00:41:15,884 --> 00:41:20,564
I knew a fix was
coming. I could feel it.

639
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:27,837
Then, another medium and I went through and
cleansed every single inch of this house.

640
00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:35,443
I felt like every spirit
in here was just lifted out.

641
00:41:35,444 --> 00:41:39,908
The spirits have gone now.
May they rest in peace.

642
00:41:39,909 --> 00:41:45,809
I immediately felt an easy feeling,
a feeling that they'd really moved on.

643
00:41:48,335 --> 00:41:52,024
The Small House dates back to 1854.

644
00:41:52,025 --> 00:41:55,986
Now that the house is cleansed
and the spirits are released,

645
00:41:55,987 --> 00:41:58,920
we know that the arts
council will continue on

646
00:41:58,921 --> 00:42:03,468
in providing arts
programming for the community.

647
00:42:03,469 --> 00:42:07,255
I hope that Ashley will come
back and start volunteering again,

648
00:42:07,256 --> 00:42:11,096
and that she'll feel safe here.

649
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:16,348
I'm impressed that Kara
accepted this responsibility,

650
00:42:16,349 --> 00:42:19,079
and took control of
this difficult cleanse.

651
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,895
The decision to stand
in for Ashley was risky,

652
00:42:21,896 --> 00:42:26,817
but from what I hear, the dead within
the Small House are finally free.
