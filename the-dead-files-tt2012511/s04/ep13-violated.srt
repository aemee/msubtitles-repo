1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,483
There is something bad
here that's not a human.

3
00:00:14,484 --> 00:00:16,953
You'll catch them out of
the corner of your eye.

4
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:20,148
There are growling noises.

5
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:22,130
There was a murder that
took place in the house.

6
00:00:22,131 --> 00:00:23,732
And he died right there on the floor.

7
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:25,701
This thing's torturing people.

8
00:00:25,702 --> 00:00:27,202
And it just hurts.

9
00:00:27,203 --> 00:00:30,803
I feel like it violates her.

10
00:00:30,957 --> 00:00:35,397
They're not safe anywhere in this house.

11
00:00:35,812 --> 00:00:38,163
They're being watched.

12
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:41,049
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,251
This thing likes death.

14
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,987
I see dead people.

15
00:00:44,988 --> 00:00:46,622
This thing's, like, a monster.

16
00:00:46,623 --> 00:00:48,657
I speak to dead people.

17
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:50,191
And he's pissed off now.

18
00:00:50,192 --> 00:00:51,860
And they speak to me.

19
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:53,128
His head was cracked.

20
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,999
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,448
This guy was murdered.

22
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:00,101
I rely on my partner.

23
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:03,128
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

24
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,908
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

25
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,244
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:09,245 --> 00:01:10,679
You saw her?

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,914
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:11,915 --> 00:01:13,189
Why would you stay here?

29
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,417
But Steve and I never speak...

30
00:01:15,418 --> 00:01:17,352
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:17,353 --> 00:01:18,720
Until the very end.

32
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:20,556
Stop it.

33
00:01:20,557 --> 00:01:22,424
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

34
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:25,027
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

35
00:01:25,028 --> 00:01:26,327
Or time to get out.

36
00:01:26,328 --> 00:01:31,068
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

37
00:01:45,214 --> 00:01:48,950
Amy and I conduct
separate investigations.

38
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:53,565
I gather witness testimony and look for
hidden truths about the property's past.

39
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:56,992
While Amy communicates
with the other side.

40
00:01:56,993 --> 00:02:00,428
I'm in Fort Wayne, Indiana, a
couple hours North of Indianapolis.

41
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:03,284
We got called in by this guy named Mark.

42
00:02:03,285 --> 00:02:05,371
Mark said things are
so bad in this house,

43
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:07,617
his 18-year-old daughter is
afraid to go to bed at night.

44
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:11,403
And his wife's so scared, she moved
out and is living with her mother.

45
00:02:11,404 --> 00:02:17,304
Mark says he wants his life back,
and he thinks we're his last chance.

46
00:02:23,728 --> 00:02:28,270
Before Amy arrives, I clear anything
that could influence her findings.

47
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:31,181
This house has a lot of family
photographs and antique collectibles,

48
00:02:31,182 --> 00:02:35,262
that need to be covered or removed.

49
00:02:36,237 --> 00:02:42,137
When I'm finished, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

50
00:03:01,713 --> 00:03:07,173
There is something definitely
not right about the land.

51
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,451
There's a little old man.

52
00:03:10,452 --> 00:03:12,233
He says...

53
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:17,053
That a lot of bad things
happened there with that family.

54
00:03:17,054 --> 00:03:20,441
There was also, like,
a murder that happened.

55
00:03:20,442 --> 00:03:23,477
Somehow that ties in, too.

56
00:03:23,478 --> 00:03:26,718
I feel weak, unstable...

57
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:32,464
Like something's trying to jump me.

58
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:45,369
Mark, on the phone, you mentioned how

59
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,226
bad things were in the
house here, what's going on?

60
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:50,471
I've seen an apparition.

61
00:03:50,472 --> 00:03:54,823
I've been touched, hit with things.
My wife's been, you know, messed with.

62
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:57,518
We'll go sometimes for like a month
or two, and nothing will happen.

63
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,872
And then it'll be continuous for weeks.

64
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:01,664
Okay, so how long you been here?

65
00:04:01,665 --> 00:04:05,987
We've been here for 8 years,
and I bought it for $11,600.

66
00:04:05,988 --> 00:04:07,006
Why so cheap?

67
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:09,669
It stood vacant for 8
years before I moved in.

68
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,813
Why don't you just sell the
house and get out of here?

69
00:04:11,814 --> 00:04:14,673
You know, it's finances, and
the thing is, it's my house.

70
00:04:14,674 --> 00:04:16,113
I get that.

71
00:04:16,114 --> 00:04:17,999
What do you know about
the history of the house?

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,732
I had heard that there was a
murder that took place in the house.

73
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:23,838
Well, how long ago do you
think this homicide was?

74
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,114
It happened in '96.

75
00:04:26,115 --> 00:04:28,276
You mentioned it was affecting
the family, in what way?

76
00:04:28,277 --> 00:04:30,086
I just reunited with
my daughter recently,

77
00:04:30,087 --> 00:04:32,748
but she doesn't like
being in the house alone.

78
00:04:32,749 --> 00:04:35,583
And my wife won't even stay
in the house by herself.

79
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:38,619
If I'm not here, she'll
go stay at her mother's.

80
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,534
It's come close to us breaking up
over it. It's affecting my work.

81
00:04:42,535 --> 00:04:47,515
- What do you do?
- Well, here, I'll show you.

82
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:58,095
- I buy and sell antique firearms.
- Can I take a look at one of these?

83
00:04:58,096 --> 00:04:59,858
- Oh, yeah. Help yourself.
- Are they loaded?

84
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:01,498
No.

85
00:05:01,499 --> 00:05:03,645
They were used pretty heavy in combat...

86
00:05:03,646 --> 00:05:05,513
Civil War, Indian Wars.

87
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:09,659
I guarantee some of these guns
in here have killed people.

88
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,920
Actually, that's a Confederate pinfire.

89
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:16,829
What do you hope that we can do
for you with this investigation?

90
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,441
I'd like to get my family back together.

91
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:22,870
I'd like my wife to be able to stay
here, my daughter to feel comfortable.

92
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:25,154
But it's really hard to do
with the way things are going.

93
00:05:25,155 --> 00:05:27,435
All right.

94
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:36,377
This is almost like an antique store.

95
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:41,264
So, sometimes, I go to antique
stores, but I'll get drained and sick.

96
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:44,160
Because sometimes, there are...

97
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:47,941
Energies associated with objects.

98
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:54,840
There are some objects here that do
have some residual energies to them.

99
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:02,070
I feel really weak here.

100
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:03,725
I don't feel very good.

101
00:06:03,726 --> 00:06:06,666
I don't feel good.

102
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,787
Okay, Mark, so what did you
bring me down the basement for?

103
00:06:19,788 --> 00:06:22,466
I was sweeping the floor
down here and fairly

104
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:24,502
decent-sized bolt hit me
in the center of the back.

105
00:06:24,503 --> 00:06:26,543
- You were down here alone?
- I was down here alone.

106
00:06:26,544 --> 00:06:28,826
What about windows somebody
have chucked something at you?

107
00:06:28,827 --> 00:06:31,804
No, the windows are shut.
Yeah, you can't open them.

108
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:34,459
Okay. Have you experienced
anything else down here?

109
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,017
Yeah. Yeah, I'll see
shadows down here a lot.

110
00:06:37,018 --> 00:06:38,201
What kind of shadows?

111
00:06:38,202 --> 00:06:40,405
They're like a solid
black mass or something.

112
00:06:40,406 --> 00:06:42,277
You'll catch them out
of the corner of the eye.

113
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:44,335
You'll be standing there
and you'll see something...

114
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:47,419
- Phoom! You know across the room.
- You're sure it's not a light reflection?

115
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,884
I'm positive it's not a light reflection
these windows were all covered up.

116
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:56,225
It feels sometimes almost
like things hide down here.

117
00:07:01,364 --> 00:07:03,631
This is bad, bad area.

118
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,492
Bah.

119
00:07:05,532 --> 00:07:10,932
There is something very
bad here that's not a human.

120
00:07:13,242 --> 00:07:17,212
I don't know if it's ever been
human, but it's not human now.

121
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:20,691
I'm staring at this black
mass crouching in the basement.

122
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:24,012
I'm not sure what it is, but I
can tell it has evil intentions,

123
00:07:24,013 --> 00:07:26,951
and hates living people in its space.

124
00:07:26,952 --> 00:07:31,397
And there is, like,
definitely a pathway here.

125
00:07:31,398 --> 00:07:36,697
But I think it goes possibly
next door or underground.

126
00:07:36,698 --> 00:07:41,378
It doesn't like me.
It wants me to leave.

127
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,890
This room is not good, though.

128
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:53,448
Mark, why'd you bring me up in here?

129
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:55,630
This is one of the areas
we hear a lot of the noises.

130
00:07:55,631 --> 00:07:57,272
What kind of sounds
are we talking about?

131
00:07:57,273 --> 00:08:01,204
Growling, tappings, clicking noises.

132
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:03,006
So, are you the only
one hearing these noises?

133
00:08:03,007 --> 00:08:04,818
Oh, no. My wife does all the time.

134
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:06,735
She won't even sleep up here by herself.

135
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,217
Let me ask you a question, with
all the stuff you got going on,

136
00:08:09,218 --> 00:08:11,858
the noises, the banging how
are you sleeping at night?

137
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:12,958
I'm not.

138
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,852
- I sleep during the day for the most part.
- Because of what's going on?

139
00:08:15,853 --> 00:08:17,134
Because of what's going on yeah.

140
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:19,540
- Well how the freak do you live like that?
- I can't really.

141
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:24,881
That's why I want you
guys to do what you can do.

142
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:35,919
That thing kind of likes this
area, kind of likes this space.

143
00:08:39,316 --> 00:08:41,751
The evil black mass I
encountered in the basement,

144
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:44,314
makes its presence felt
all over this house,

145
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,135
and it especially likes
the upstairs bedrooms.

146
00:08:47,136 --> 00:08:51,577
It makes lots of, like,
weird growling noises...

147
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:53,798
To scare.

148
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:57,576
That's kind of how he communicates.

149
00:08:57,577 --> 00:09:01,177
I don't know what it wants.

150
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,551
So what else is going on up here?

151
00:09:03,552 --> 00:09:05,126
This chest right here...

152
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:11,027
One day this chest had been moved
and set blocking off the doorway.

153
00:09:11,494 --> 00:09:15,663
It's a heavy chest, and it was
full of antique guns at the time.

154
00:09:15,664 --> 00:09:17,682
Wow. It's heavy as hell.

155
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,603
Yeah.

156
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:25,120
- I mean, nobody broke in up here?
- Positive.

157
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:26,874
Experience anything else?

158
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,728
Me and my wife were arguing,

159
00:09:28,729 --> 00:09:31,412
and there was a small travel-size
bottle of hand lotion sitting

160
00:09:31,413 --> 00:09:33,840
on the dresser that actually
flew and hit me in the chest.

161
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,116
While she was arguing with you?

162
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:38,042
- Are you sure she didn't fling it at you?
- No she didn't fling it at me.

163
00:09:38,043 --> 00:09:40,755
It started shaking
before it even took off.

164
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:42,383
So what else is going on up here?

165
00:09:42,384 --> 00:09:46,966
I fell asleep, I was watching TV, and I
had my head propped up on my hand in bed.

166
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:49,769
And I'm laying there and all of a
sudden, I wake up when my head jerks.

167
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,856
Something had smacked
my hand away from my arm.

168
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,465
Actually left a hand print on my arm.

169
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:55,467
And it looked like it might
have been a man's hand.

170
00:09:55,468 --> 00:09:57,192
You feel like you're
getting picked on here?

171
00:09:57,193 --> 00:09:59,674
Yeah. I actually do.
It seems not to like me.

172
00:09:59,675 --> 00:10:02,248
But I'm also the one that
confronts it the most.

173
00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:04,169
Okay.

174
00:10:04,594 --> 00:10:08,314
This big gigantic black blob...

175
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:11,060
Whether it's touching, objects moving,

176
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:14,683
that there is a lot of physical
phenomena that this thing can do...

177
00:10:14,684 --> 00:10:17,628
Throwing people down stairs...

178
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:19,782
Or smacking them.

179
00:10:19,783 --> 00:10:23,184
It's a pretty, pretty powerful thing.

180
00:10:23,185 --> 00:10:28,825
Especially when this thing
might be into torturing people.

181
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:56,949
Kim, Mark mentioned that he hears all
types of different noises and sounds.

182
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,553
What about yourself?

183
00:10:58,554 --> 00:11:02,054
The things that we notice the
most were, like, tapping noises.

184
00:11:02,055 --> 00:11:04,916
Sometimes, there are growling noises.

185
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:06,834
I've had my name whispered.

186
00:11:06,835 --> 00:11:10,033
And when you heard your name
whispered, was it a male or a female?

187
00:11:10,034 --> 00:11:12,097
It was male.

188
00:11:12,098 --> 00:11:15,494
Also, sometimes you'll
see, like, black mists.

189
00:11:15,495 --> 00:11:16,984
Okay.

190
00:11:16,985 --> 00:11:19,447
Is there anything else
happening in this bedroom?

191
00:11:19,448 --> 00:11:22,729
The bed sometimes will shake.

192
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,420
Sometimes a lot, I thought
we were having earthquakes.

193
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:28,297
I mean, you got trains... you
got heavy trucks going by here.

194
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:31,547
Well, let's say a semi
goes by real fast...

195
00:11:31,548 --> 00:11:34,297
The windows shake, but not the bed.

196
00:11:34,298 --> 00:11:35,518
Okay.

197
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,108
Anybody who stays here with us for
any period of time gets touched...

198
00:11:41,109 --> 00:11:43,305
Like somebody's sitting
in the bed with you,

199
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:45,597
you know, like an
indentation in the bed.

200
00:11:45,598 --> 00:11:48,898
Where it looks like somebody's sitting
there, and you can't see anybody.

201
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,819
Okay.

202
00:11:59,256 --> 00:12:03,876
I see this woman who
lives in this house.

203
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:06,657
She's a living person.

204
00:12:06,658 --> 00:12:09,552
And this dark thing...

205
00:12:09,553 --> 00:12:13,813
It definitely wants something from her.

206
00:12:14,611 --> 00:12:19,231
She's seeing this huge
black shadow thing.

207
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:24,237
Like, I do feel, like, this weight on
my shoulders, like, being held down...

208
00:12:24,238 --> 00:12:27,598
In bed by my shoulders...

209
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,369
Like, maybe shook.

210
00:12:35,224 --> 00:12:37,916
There are times that I get
really, you know, frightened.

211
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:42,187
I mean, I'm not even functional anymore.

212
00:12:42,188 --> 00:12:45,590
Right. Mark explained that you're actually
staying at your mom's most of the time.

213
00:12:45,591 --> 00:12:46,392
Mm-hmm.

214
00:12:46,393 --> 00:12:48,957
Well I would assume this has got
to take a toll on your marriage.

215
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:54,433
Yeah, it does. The past two months,
I've been away all but about two weeks.

216
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:57,196
- Okay.
- So, lately, we've hardly seen each other.

217
00:12:57,197 --> 00:13:00,300
What are your feelings like when you
just come into the house, do they change?

218
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:02,853
Well, it seems to go in cycles.

219
00:13:02,854 --> 00:13:05,677
Sometimes there's a lot of
activity, and sometimes there's not.

220
00:13:05,678 --> 00:13:06,543
Okay.

221
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:11,150
But when I come in the house,
I feel this, like, heaviness.

222
00:13:11,151 --> 00:13:13,418
Ever since I've been
here, it's like I've just

223
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:17,187
been totally drained of
energy... just zapped.

224
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:22,993
I say it all the time, I can't
wait to get out of this house.

225
00:13:22,994 --> 00:13:28,894
This dark thing feels like it's
pushed a lot of illness in...

226
00:13:30,002 --> 00:13:31,803
Lots of illness.

227
00:13:31,804 --> 00:13:35,642
Yeah, like it's pushing
this, like, waves.

228
00:13:35,643 --> 00:13:39,278
It, like... I just see waves coming in.

229
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:45,179
This evil black mass travels in and out of
the house through a portal in the basement.

230
00:13:45,318 --> 00:13:50,566
When it's gone, things get better,
but it's definitely here now.

231
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:53,328
There's a wave happening right now.

232
00:13:53,329 --> 00:13:57,010
It's either depression, like
really, really bad depression,

233
00:13:57,011 --> 00:14:00,911
or physical illness and bad luck.

234
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,840
So, it'll be really bad.

235
00:14:16,132 --> 00:14:18,130
Shaela, I was talking
to your dad earlier,

236
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:21,566
and he mentioned that you're
uncomfortable being in the house alone.

237
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:23,803
- Is that true?
- Mm hmm.

238
00:14:23,804 --> 00:14:25,447
Okay, how long have
you been living here?

239
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,847
I've been living here
about five months now.

240
00:14:27,848 --> 00:14:32,567
Mark's my dad, and we just found
each other when I turned 18.

241
00:14:32,568 --> 00:14:33,620
Okay.

242
00:14:33,621 --> 00:14:37,230
Mark tells me his daughter spent a
lot of time in and out of foster homes,

243
00:14:37,231 --> 00:14:40,178
but even after reuniting with
her father and stepmother,

244
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,644
I got the feeling she's
still not finding any peace.

245
00:14:43,645 --> 00:14:46,478
Now, what's the most frightening
thing in the house for you?

246
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:52,179
I get this, like, weird vibe
of, like, sadness and anger.

247
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:55,810
And I've felt, like, fingers
running through my hair,

248
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,590
or, like, something,
like, touching my cheek.

249
00:14:58,591 --> 00:15:00,715
It just absolutely just mortifies me.

250
00:15:00,716 --> 00:15:02,494
What do you mean by that?

251
00:15:02,495 --> 00:15:05,495
I had a rough past.

252
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,650
I was abused...

253
00:15:09,558 --> 00:15:11,537
Sexually.

254
00:15:11,538 --> 00:15:17,198
And when I feel these things,
it reminds me of my childhood.

255
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,459
I feel really safe being with my dad.

256
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:24,969
But the house doesn't make me feel safe.

257
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,820
Like, I'll hear the door handle turn.

258
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:31,161
And then...

259
00:15:33,101 --> 00:15:39,001
So, that doorknob turning brings you
back to when you were... molested.

260
00:15:40,213 --> 00:15:44,399
It's the scariest thing in the world.

261
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,133
The pain that you felt just
plays over and over in your head.

262
00:15:48,134 --> 00:15:54,034
And then your heart starts pounding, and
next thing you know, you're just in tears.

263
00:15:54,073 --> 00:15:59,973
Something paranormal's bringing
back that memory, and it just hurts.

264
00:16:04,657 --> 00:16:10,362
This older woman comes up, and
she is concerned about someone...

265
00:16:10,363 --> 00:16:14,623
Like, a girl who lives in this house.

266
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:20,849
And this woman feels like she's a protector
of this person she's talking about.

267
00:16:25,232 --> 00:16:30,343
Like, she's just going on, saying that
the situation is really, really dire.

268
00:16:30,344 --> 00:16:33,070
And that's why she's here.

269
00:16:33,071 --> 00:16:36,689
This older woman is worried about
a young girl that lives here.

270
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,144
She wants to protect her
from the evil black mass

271
00:16:39,145 --> 00:16:43,705
that's terrorizing
everyone in this house.

272
00:16:47,398 --> 00:16:50,786
I feel like it violates her.

273
00:16:50,787 --> 00:16:53,607
What do you mean?

274
00:16:54,327 --> 00:16:57,507
Like, kind of sexually.

275
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:02,809
It's not good.

276
00:17:18,035 --> 00:17:21,081
With so much bizarre activity
going on inside Mark's house,

277
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:25,376
I need to separate the easily
explained from the unexplained.

278
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,223
So I've called in an
animal-control expert,

279
00:17:27,224 --> 00:17:33,124
to see if he can make sense of all
of the strange sounds in the house.

280
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,782
My clients are complaining about

281
00:17:40,783 --> 00:17:43,240
hearing tapping noises
and stuff like that.

282
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:45,501
Now, is that something you
get a lot of complaints about?

283
00:17:45,502 --> 00:17:48,752
Yes, we do, and that ends
up turning out to be mice.

284
00:17:48,753 --> 00:17:54,283
So, they're also complaining about hearing
growling, now, what animals would that be?

285
00:17:54,284 --> 00:17:56,185
I have never heard that complaint.

286
00:17:56,186 --> 00:17:58,868
Okay. If you could do me a
favor, give this place a good

287
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,467
once-over so I can at
least rule that out.

288
00:18:01,468 --> 00:18:03,388
Okay.

289
00:18:04,344 --> 00:18:06,532
With over 20 years on
the Police Department,

290
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:11,513
I know you have to rule
out the obvious first.

291
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:17,767
Then I can focus on what
physical evidence can't explain.

292
00:18:17,768 --> 00:18:19,969
So did you find anything?

293
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,861
Nothing... everything seems
completely clean to me.

294
00:18:22,862 --> 00:18:26,213
Were you able to find any openings that
maybe animals could come in and out?

295
00:18:26,214 --> 00:18:29,684
No, there's not one sign of any opening.

296
00:18:29,685 --> 00:18:31,669
Okay, thanks for the good
work. I appreciate that.

297
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,770
Mm-hmm.

298
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:38,988
Mark told me someone was killed
in this house in the '90s.

299
00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:42,224
If anybody knows about this,
it's gonna be the local cops.

300
00:18:42,225 --> 00:18:44,511
I'm heading over to meet
with a retired Detective

301
00:18:44,512 --> 00:18:47,463
who actually worked Mark's
neighborhood during that time.

302
00:18:47,464 --> 00:18:53,364
He tells me he's got some information
that will definitely help my case.

303
00:18:58,569 --> 00:19:02,693
So, A.J., my client said there was a
possible murder in his house back in

304
00:19:02,694 --> 00:19:05,574
the '90s, and it sounds like you were
able to verify that, is that right?

305
00:19:05,575 --> 00:19:09,355
Right. Back in December of '96.

306
00:19:10,008 --> 00:19:13,403
This was the victim, Alberto Lopez.

307
00:19:13,404 --> 00:19:15,124
He looks like a young
guy. How old was he?

308
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,757
He was only 25.

309
00:19:16,758 --> 00:19:18,707
So, how'd the homicide go down?

310
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:22,288
He had a live-in girlfriend
named Lucy Rivera.

311
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:26,125
She was considerably
older. I believe she was 43.

312
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:31,259
They got into an altercation, and he
took off running to get away from her.

313
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,900
She had a knife, and she
stabbed him in the back.

314
00:19:34,901 --> 00:19:38,476
It was a fatal blow, and he
died right there on the floor,

315
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:42,077
right in front of the stove.

316
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:50,771
I feel like there's a younger male...

317
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:55,325
Here who doesn't want to be bothered.

318
00:19:55,326 --> 00:20:01,226
Like, he doesn't want to be involved
in anything, and he'll lash out.

319
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:07,730
Do you know when he died?

320
00:20:07,731 --> 00:20:09,988
I would say like...

321
00:20:09,989 --> 00:20:11,913
'80s, '90s.

322
00:20:11,914 --> 00:20:14,945
- Do you get an age on him?
- 25 maybe?

323
00:20:14,946 --> 00:20:17,406
He's creepy.

324
00:20:19,913 --> 00:20:21,654
A.J., what do we know about the victim?

325
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:23,783
Not much of anything.

326
00:20:23,784 --> 00:20:27,234
Nobody even knew him
from the neighborhood.

327
00:20:27,235 --> 00:20:31,626
No Mexicans stepped forward to
shed any light on who he was,

328
00:20:31,627 --> 00:20:35,345
and nobody even claimed the body.

329
00:20:35,346 --> 00:20:38,148
Now, I'm assuming she gets collared
for this, she gets arrested, right?

330
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:43,425
She gets arrested. In fact, there's
the article after the incident.

331
00:20:43,426 --> 00:20:47,134
She ends up taking a charge
of aggravated battery.

332
00:20:47,135 --> 00:20:50,915
And took a plea, got 10 years.

333
00:20:50,987 --> 00:20:52,928
And she served 8 of them.

334
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:54,863
Now, what's her story?

335
00:20:54,864 --> 00:20:57,615
She was claiming domestic abuse.

336
00:20:57,616 --> 00:20:59,998
There as an incident at a local bar...

337
00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:02,782
That she had told people that...

338
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:06,499
"The next time he hits me,
that's it I'm gonna kill him".

339
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,100
She was at a breaking point.

340
00:21:12,557 --> 00:21:15,577
He doesn't like the people here.

341
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:18,482
People are not leaving him alone.

342
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:20,703
So, he...

343
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:24,141
Is distraught over this.

344
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:27,871
People are bothering him...

345
00:21:27,985 --> 00:21:30,646
Dead and living.

346
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:34,918
I'm not sure, but I do
feel like he killed himself.

347
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:40,439
He has so much anxiety, so
much stress, so much anger.

348
00:21:54,118 --> 00:21:58,421
I'm at the library to see
what else I can uncover.

349
00:21:58,422 --> 00:22:02,058
Digging through the archives, I
find a family by the name of Olds,

350
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:07,329
who used to own my clients' property as
a business investment in the late 1800s.

351
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,193
Turns out they were one of the most

352
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:12,002
influential families
in Fort Wayne's history.

353
00:22:12,003 --> 00:22:17,903
But a local genealogist tells me
they also had their share of misery.

354
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,985
John, when I did my research,
I came across the Olds family.

355
00:22:25,986 --> 00:22:27,669
It looked like they
were pretty prominent,

356
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,956
and they owned the property
I'm actually investigating.

357
00:22:29,957 --> 00:22:31,240
What can you tell me about them?

358
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:34,057
They were one of the top families
in Fort Wayne in the 1800s.

359
00:22:34,058 --> 00:22:39,474
This is Henry G. Olds. He
inherited the property back in 1876.

360
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:42,866
He was a very prominent man that
had a lot of mercantile interests.

361
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:44,324
When did Henry die?

362
00:22:44,325 --> 00:22:47,672
He died in 1902. He was 62 years old.

363
00:22:47,673 --> 00:22:49,722
He had a series of strokes.

364
00:22:49,723 --> 00:22:52,141
Each one left him more
and more of an invalid.

365
00:22:52,142 --> 00:22:54,663
He was eventually
confined to a wheelchair.

366
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,534
And then he finally died at his house,

367
00:22:57,535 --> 00:23:00,550
leaving a widow and several sons
who took over his businesses.

368
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:03,152
Okay, so, now who inherits the
property that I'm investigating?

369
00:23:03,153 --> 00:23:07,624
His widow, Caroline... we see here
on the left, inherits the property.

370
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,919
So, what happens to
Caroline after he dies?

371
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,330
Well, there was a series of lawsuits
that really harmed the family.

372
00:23:13,331 --> 00:23:14,449
Well, why is that?

373
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,756
Well, they had a wagon
factory, and in 1902,

374
00:23:17,757 --> 00:23:21,504
just months after Henry died, one
of the workers fell and was killed.

375
00:23:21,505 --> 00:23:23,272
It was not a safe place.

376
00:23:23,273 --> 00:23:27,934
People were really unprotected, and there
was no one to oversee any kind of safety.

377
00:23:27,935 --> 00:23:30,855
And so the widow sued
the company for $10,000.

378
00:23:30,856 --> 00:23:32,317
That was a lot of money back then.

379
00:23:32,318 --> 00:23:36,611
A lot of money, yes, and that certainly
took a big chunk out of their wealth.

380
00:23:36,612 --> 00:23:39,686
The coal company also got hit
with a big lawsuit in 1913.

381
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:42,582
A man was killed when some coal
was being unloaded from a train.

382
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,861
And then there was a fire in 1920.

383
00:23:44,862 --> 00:23:46,633
The glove factory that they owned that,

384
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:48,916
conjoined the coal company
burned to the ground.

385
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:52,902
Okay, so they wind up losing a
lot between lawsuits and accidents.

386
00:23:52,903 --> 00:23:54,763
Yes.

387
00:23:55,673 --> 00:24:00,933
I'm just seeing, like, these
two dead old men talking a lot.

388
00:24:00,934 --> 00:24:03,835
They weren't paid well.

389
00:24:03,836 --> 00:24:07,256
They had no rights. And...

390
00:24:08,048 --> 00:24:09,948
They're pissed. They're
just [Bleep] pissed.

391
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,973
They're mad about
their living conditions.

392
00:24:11,974 --> 00:24:15,874
They're mad about how they died.

393
00:24:16,694 --> 00:24:18,529
But I do feel like
they worked underground,

394
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,464
like they were miners or
something of that nature.

395
00:24:21,465 --> 00:24:23,733
And the one said, I
died with my boots on.

396
00:24:23,734 --> 00:24:26,854
All I see is Earth...

397
00:24:27,287 --> 00:24:30,167
Rushing in on him.

398
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:33,009
So, now what happens to the sons?

399
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:37,647
One of the sons, Noble, died
in 1918 at a young age of 48.

400
00:24:37,648 --> 00:24:40,607
Then two years later,
the other son, Eugene,

401
00:24:40,608 --> 00:24:43,720
died of a massive heart attack
inside their house here in Fort Wayne.

402
00:24:43,721 --> 00:24:46,087
- And how old was he?
- 47.

403
00:24:46,088 --> 00:24:48,834
So she lost both her
sons within two years?

404
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:50,169
Terrible blow for her.

405
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,228
Okay, so, now what winds
up happening to her?

406
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:54,130
Well, she sells the mansion,

407
00:24:54,131 --> 00:24:58,702
and then ends up in a workers' cottage
with her daughter in basic poverty.

408
00:24:58,703 --> 00:25:01,942
And that's the big irony of this whole
thing, because here is a lady who lived

409
00:25:01,943 --> 00:25:04,946
in a mansion in Fort Wayne, and then
ends up spending her life living in the

410
00:25:04,947 --> 00:25:07,470
very kind of cottages
that the workers lived in,

411
00:25:07,471 --> 00:25:09,450
just like her own workers
in her own factory.

412
00:25:09,451 --> 00:25:11,614
Okay, so she's close to the
property I'm investigating?

413
00:25:11,615 --> 00:25:13,830
It was a few houses down
from where the house is now,

414
00:25:13,831 --> 00:25:18,511
but at that time, it
was all one property.

415
00:25:26,305 --> 00:25:30,593
During my walk, I
encountered several entities.

416
00:25:30,594 --> 00:25:35,324
So, I had a sketch artist
draw the most prominent two.

417
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,808
First, the dark figure
I saw in the basement.

418
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:41,644
Is he looking at you?

419
00:25:41,645 --> 00:25:42,712
Yes.

420
00:25:42,713 --> 00:25:44,518
A very solid black.

421
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:46,850
He is like this.

422
00:25:46,851 --> 00:25:48,252
- Okay.
- Mm hmm.

423
00:25:48,253 --> 00:25:51,441
Next, I describe the
distraught young man.

424
00:25:51,442 --> 00:25:54,742
He has short brown hair.

425
00:25:54,945 --> 00:25:57,908
Like here... he's got shadowing
here and then shadowing here.

426
00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:01,089
That's all I remember.

427
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,391
Is that what you saw?

428
00:26:04,392 --> 00:26:06,252
Yes.

429
00:26:28,891 --> 00:26:32,371
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations.

430
00:26:32,372 --> 00:26:36,999
We're ready to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

431
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,285
Amy, I'd like you to meet the family
that actually lives in this house.

432
00:26:40,286 --> 00:26:45,534
This is Mark, this is his wife, Kim,
and this is his daughter, Shaela.

433
00:26:45,535 --> 00:26:47,961
Activity has gotten pretty
bad in the house here.

434
00:26:47,962 --> 00:26:50,538
Shaela doesn't sleep at all at night.

435
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:52,584
Kim actually goes to
her mom's house to sleep.

436
00:26:52,585 --> 00:26:56,020
That's how frightened she is.

437
00:26:56,021 --> 00:26:59,277
They want to know if they can live
here normally and as a family together.

438
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:03,515
So, they feel we're their last hope,
and that's why they called us in.

439
00:27:03,516 --> 00:27:06,462
So, with that, I'm gonna turn
the conversation over to Amy,

440
00:27:06,463 --> 00:27:09,763
and hear about her walk.

441
00:27:11,699 --> 00:27:15,531
So, when I walked in,
I got the same feeling

442
00:27:15,532 --> 00:27:18,584
I get when I walk into an antique store.

443
00:27:18,585 --> 00:27:22,493
And I felt that there were, in
fact, objects at this location

444
00:27:22,494 --> 00:27:26,952
that held some kind of residual
energy that could be draining.

445
00:27:26,953 --> 00:27:31,720
You know, we've been to dozens
of locations that have antiques,

446
00:27:31,721 --> 00:27:35,901
and this is the first case
where it was distracting.

447
00:27:35,902 --> 00:27:37,983
Actually, Mark here can help you out.

448
00:27:37,984 --> 00:27:39,906
Why don't you tell Amy
what you do for a living?

449
00:27:39,907 --> 00:27:43,021
I deal in pre-1898 firearms.

450
00:27:43,022 --> 00:27:43,932
Wow.

451
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:46,320
And he's got quite a few.
I've seen the collection.

452
00:27:46,321 --> 00:27:48,797
About 30, I think, right now.

453
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:50,962
I have one that was
from the Indian Wars.

454
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:52,998
Wow. Probably 1870s.

455
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:56,459
And I have a Confederate pinfire
pistol, which I'm sure was used.

456
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,355
And they're in the house?

457
00:27:58,356 --> 00:27:59,471
Yeah.

458
00:27:59,472 --> 00:28:01,973
Okay, very interesting. All right.

459
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:05,421
That might have been
why it's so draining,

460
00:28:05,422 --> 00:28:08,585
and if anybody is, you
know, kind of sensitive...

461
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:11,454
They could feel the draining.

462
00:28:11,455 --> 00:28:14,818
That's me. I mean, I have just
no energy since I've been here.

463
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:17,060
It's just gone downhill,
you know, to where...

464
00:28:17,061 --> 00:28:20,901
Yeah, I'm barely functional now.

465
00:28:23,129 --> 00:28:25,897
What else did you see?

466
00:28:25,898 --> 00:28:28,874
In the garage, I met a male.

467
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:31,941
Probably between 18 and 25 years old.

468
00:28:31,942 --> 00:28:36,253
He, frankly, doesn't want to be
bothered with the living or the dead.

469
00:28:36,254 --> 00:28:39,421
And he feels like his space,
which he has made out there,

470
00:28:39,422 --> 00:28:42,442
is being violated by
the living and the dead.

471
00:28:42,443 --> 00:28:47,181
So he feels a lot of
anxiety, stress, and anger.

472
00:28:47,182 --> 00:28:49,721
I believe he killed himself.

473
00:28:49,722 --> 00:28:53,742
And this was in the '80s or '90s.

474
00:28:56,307 --> 00:29:00,636
There was only one death in this house back
in the time frame you're talking about,

475
00:29:00,637 --> 00:29:02,200
but it wasn't a suicide.

476
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:03,603
Oh, really?

477
00:29:03,604 --> 00:29:08,034
A guy by the name of Alberto Lopez lived
in this house with his girlfriend...

478
00:29:08,035 --> 00:29:09,240
Lucy Rivera.

479
00:29:09,241 --> 00:29:15,141
He was 25 years old, she was 43, and
they had a very volatile relationship.

480
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:17,884
This is him.

481
00:29:17,885 --> 00:29:20,045
Oh, wow.

482
00:29:23,122 --> 00:29:27,996
Now, I have an article
here about the girlfriend.

483
00:29:27,997 --> 00:29:33,786
Back in 1996, he winds up getting into an
altercation with his female partner here.

484
00:29:33,787 --> 00:29:39,687
She stabs him one time in the back, and
he winds up dying upstairs in the kitchen.

485
00:29:39,855 --> 00:29:42,407
You said this guy was
dealing with a lot of anger.

486
00:29:42,408 --> 00:29:43,640
Yeah.

487
00:29:43,641 --> 00:29:49,161
The girlfriend was claiming
that he repeatedly beat her.

488
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:53,600
So, do you think this is
the guy you might have seen?

489
00:29:53,601 --> 00:29:57,921
I did a sketch. You guys can tell me.

490
00:30:02,862 --> 00:30:08,082
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, it looks pretty close to me.

491
00:30:09,402 --> 00:30:13,302
I'm just amazed at the likeness.

492
00:30:13,744 --> 00:30:16,411
At first look, I wasn't
so sure about Amy's sketch.

493
00:30:16,412 --> 00:30:22,113
But you put a mustache on him,
and it's a pretty close match.

494
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:25,946
I felt like he killed himself
because he wanted to be alone.

495
00:30:25,947 --> 00:30:29,771
This man was so depressed, I
assumed he'd killed himself.

496
00:30:29,772 --> 00:30:31,903
I'm not sure how he actually died,

497
00:30:31,904 --> 00:30:37,116
but one thing I am sure about,
he's still inside that garage.

498
00:30:37,117 --> 00:30:39,295
So, what else is going on?

499
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:42,602
When I came down to the basement...

500
00:30:42,603 --> 00:30:46,481
I encountered two old, angry men.

501
00:30:46,482 --> 00:30:50,275
They're angry because they felt
like they didn't have any rights.

502
00:30:50,276 --> 00:30:53,469
They were paid really terribly.

503
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:59,370
They were extremely poor and felt
that the conditions were not good.

504
00:30:59,686 --> 00:31:02,168
And they're very pissed
off about how they died,

505
00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:07,209
which seemed to be in
some kind of an accident.

506
00:31:07,293 --> 00:31:10,413
That's interesting, but the
only thing I can think of,

507
00:31:10,414 --> 00:31:13,652
during my research that
may come even close...

508
00:31:13,653 --> 00:31:17,039
Is the people that owned this
property before it was developed...

509
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,829
A family called the Olds family.

510
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,944
Very prominent in Fort
Wayne, lot of money.

511
00:31:22,945 --> 00:31:27,777
Now, they owned factories here, and their
workers lived in houses on this property.

512
00:31:27,778 --> 00:31:31,287
The way they mistreated
their employees...

513
00:31:31,288 --> 00:31:33,805
Wound up being the demise of them.

514
00:31:33,806 --> 00:31:38,342
And they bought this area as an
investment property, they didn't live here.

515
00:31:38,343 --> 00:31:41,876
Here's a picture of Henry Olds.

516
00:31:41,877 --> 00:31:44,814
Henry Olds winds up
having a stroke in 1896.

517
00:31:44,815 --> 00:31:49,871
And another five strokes
up until 1902, when he dies.

518
00:31:49,872 --> 00:31:53,860
When he died, his widow
Caroline wound up taking over.

519
00:31:53,861 --> 00:31:59,761
This is actually Caroline right here
on the left, and that's her daughter.

520
00:32:00,158 --> 00:32:03,096
When Henry died, Caroline got
hit with a few lawsuits from

521
00:32:03,097 --> 00:32:07,090
the families of mistreated
workers, and she lost everything.

522
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:12,624
So, Caroline wound up living on this
property like a pauper with her daughter.

523
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:13,925
Was it in this house?

524
00:32:13,926 --> 00:32:17,228
No, in a small house that
was built for workers...

525
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:20,670
All because of
mistreatment of employees,

526
00:32:20,671 --> 00:32:26,571
by their family and the lawsuits
that were brought against them.

527
00:32:27,943 --> 00:32:29,590
What else did you see on your walk?

528
00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:32,797
I saw, down here in the basement...

529
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:35,261
This funky, nasty thing.

530
00:32:35,262 --> 00:32:38,139
I'm not sure if it's ever been human.

531
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:42,520
It's rather large, very powerful, and...

532
00:32:42,735 --> 00:32:44,284
Negative.

533
00:32:44,285 --> 00:32:48,560
Sometimes, I could see it as
a dark blob or like an animal.

534
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:52,594
And it didn't want me
here. It wanted me to leave.

535
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:55,801
I've seen a black blob upstairs.

536
00:32:55,802 --> 00:32:59,727
And I looked at it for a second, and all
of a sudden, it was like it was alive.

537
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,303
- It just took off.
- Mm hmm.

538
00:33:01,304 --> 00:33:03,947
I've seen stuff like that too,
it's just kind of like in the corner

539
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:06,695
of your eye and you go to turn
and it's not there anymore.

540
00:33:06,696 --> 00:33:07,678
Uh-huh.

541
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,582
So I had a sketch artist
sketch the scene I saw,

542
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:17,483
of the thing crouching in the
corner, down here in the basement.

543
00:33:22,829 --> 00:33:24,629
Oh.

544
00:33:24,988 --> 00:33:27,165
I usually don't get creeped out by much.

545
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:29,868
This creeps me out.

546
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:31,770
Oh, my God.

547
00:33:31,771 --> 00:33:33,931
Oh, wow.

548
00:33:36,511 --> 00:33:39,451
I'm just horrified.

549
00:33:39,873 --> 00:33:42,443
I just don't know what to make of that.

550
00:33:42,444 --> 00:33:45,536
It travels between this
house and the house next door.

551
00:33:45,537 --> 00:33:47,041
And it goes underground.

552
00:33:47,042 --> 00:33:50,548
When it's away, things are fine here.

553
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:56,440
When it comes back, it brings very
bad waves of depression and illness.

554
00:33:56,441 --> 00:33:59,242
For me, the depression comes and goes.

555
00:33:59,243 --> 00:34:05,143
I just get sick. I mean, I literally feel
sick, like I'm off-center all the time.

556
00:34:06,764 --> 00:34:09,576
One day, I'll be,
like, totally, you know,

557
00:34:09,577 --> 00:34:12,061
happy, myself, singing and
dancing around the house,

558
00:34:12,062 --> 00:34:15,199
and then I'll wake up one
day and I'm angry, depressed.

559
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,618
I'm just mad at the world for no reason.

560
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:19,641
Interesting.

561
00:34:19,642 --> 00:34:22,877
It likes the basement and the upstairs.

562
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:25,777
It growls to scare the living.

563
00:34:25,778 --> 00:34:27,871
- Really?
- Mm hmm.

564
00:34:27,872 --> 00:34:32,063
They've been complaining about
hearing sounds and growling.

565
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,126
Wow. Okay.

566
00:34:33,127 --> 00:34:37,000
So I did have a guy come in, a pest-control
guy, and check the whole house out,

567
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:39,746
and found no evidence of any...

568
00:34:39,747 --> 00:34:42,707
Rodents or animal life in the house.

569
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:44,568
Wow.

570
00:34:45,555 --> 00:34:49,704
It can get physical and
touch people or move objects.

571
00:34:49,705 --> 00:34:52,849
Frankly, I'm surprised that
it hasn't become more violent,

572
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:58,104
like maybe throwing people down the stairs
or smacking them or things of that nature.

573
00:34:58,105 --> 00:35:03,939
Well, you pretty much just described
exactly what they're all going through.

574
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:07,224
I was sweeping up down
here, and next thing I know,

575
00:35:07,225 --> 00:35:10,757
this bolt drills me in
the center of the back.

576
00:35:10,758 --> 00:35:12,775
And it hit me hard enough
to have left a Mark.

577
00:35:12,776 --> 00:35:18,676
This thing is really what's causing,
you know, havoc within the house.

578
00:35:18,982 --> 00:35:22,703
I saw it holding someone
down in the bed up there.

579
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:25,623
I saw it shaking the bed.

580
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:30,069
It just really scares me,
because I don't want it to, like,

581
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:33,362
hold me down or anything when
I'm trying to sleep and...

582
00:35:33,363 --> 00:35:37,683
I don't want it to get more physical.

583
00:35:42,048 --> 00:35:45,761
There was a woman that I met.
She's probably in her 50s.

584
00:35:45,762 --> 00:35:50,408
And she's very concerned about
a girl who lives in this house.

585
00:35:50,409 --> 00:35:54,794
She's afraid that this
girl is being violated.

586
00:35:54,795 --> 00:35:58,982
And that she's afraid that she might
be getting sexually assaulted...

587
00:35:58,983 --> 00:36:00,865
By the entity.

588
00:36:00,866 --> 00:36:03,026
Oh, God.

589
00:36:23,406 --> 00:36:26,349
There was a woman that I met.
She's probably in her 50s.

590
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:31,342
And she's very concerned about
a girl who lives in this house.

591
00:36:31,343 --> 00:36:34,831
She afraid that this
girl is being violated.

592
00:36:34,832 --> 00:36:39,879
And that she's afraid that she might
be getting sexually assaulted...

593
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,579
By the entity.

594
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,740
Oh, God.

595
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,860
When I was a kid um...

596
00:36:48,788 --> 00:36:54,311
I was sexually assaulted repeatedly
for about six or seven years.

597
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:55,946
Oh, my gosh.

598
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:59,487
I moved in five months ago.

599
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:03,511
Now that I'm here, I finally have a dad.

600
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:09,092
I feel safe that no person's
gonna assault me sexually.

601
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,071
I don't have that fear anymore.

602
00:37:11,072 --> 00:37:14,333
But I hear things in the house that...

603
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:18,138
You know, twist a doorknob. Like, it will
get me flashbacks of my childhood and...

604
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:23,239
I'm trying to get over
that fear, and I can't.

605
00:37:25,764 --> 00:37:30,829
I don't want, like, something
paranormal violating me.

606
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:34,469
This thing, you know, definitely...

607
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:37,530
Wants to invoke fear.

608
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:43,445
I believe it wants to basically
torment and torture females.

609
00:37:44,008 --> 00:37:48,132
Like, right now it's just like,
you know, I'll turn that doorknob.

610
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:51,905
Because it knows that's
going to bother you.

611
00:37:51,906 --> 00:37:55,935
And this might be why
this woman is here now...

612
00:37:55,936 --> 00:38:01,815
Is to try to help protect and try to
comfort and keep watch over the situation.

613
00:38:01,816 --> 00:38:05,180
Do me a favor, though. Describe
the finger going through the hair.

614
00:38:05,181 --> 00:38:07,660
- Yeah.
- Explain that to Amy the best you can.

615
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:13,447
It just feels like someone, like, just
kind of, like, caressing, just slowly.

616
00:38:13,448 --> 00:38:17,703
And then it kind of goes behind, like
someone tucking your hair behind the ear.

617
00:38:17,704 --> 00:38:21,346
Sometimes it's lovingly,
like, kind of motherly like,

618
00:38:21,347 --> 00:38:23,822
but in a way, like,
it still frightens me.

619
00:38:23,823 --> 00:38:28,784
- Could it be this woman that showed up?
- Could be, yes.

620
00:38:28,785 --> 00:38:30,332
But I'm not sure who she is,

621
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:34,358
but you do have a female here
who's looking out for you.

622
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:37,316
Now, this thing... is there any
way of knowing how it got here?

623
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:40,453
I'm not 100% certain at this point.

624
00:38:40,454 --> 00:38:43,990
Because he kind of shut himself down,

625
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:47,573
as soon as he understood I was
getting information from him.

626
00:38:47,574 --> 00:38:50,083
It could be family lineage.

627
00:38:50,084 --> 00:38:52,987
It could be that
somebody brought him here.

628
00:38:52,988 --> 00:38:57,881
I'm trying to, like, piece it together.
Like, how did this thing end up here?

629
00:38:57,882 --> 00:39:00,089
Is it possible that I brought him in?

630
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:04,396
Because I've brought in guns
from the, you know, 1600s, 1500s.

631
00:39:04,397 --> 00:39:09,437
Unfortunately, at this
point, anything's possible.

632
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:13,505
Well, it's been a tough night.

633
00:39:13,506 --> 00:39:15,550
But at least now you know
what you're up against.

634
00:39:15,551 --> 00:39:19,391
The question is, can you guys
live here together as a family?

635
00:39:19,392 --> 00:39:21,114
With that, I'm gonna
turn that over to Amy,

636
00:39:21,115 --> 00:39:26,035
and, hopefully, she'll
have an answer for you.

637
00:39:26,786 --> 00:39:28,920
Dealing with the negative entity...

638
00:39:28,921 --> 00:39:31,774
Now, this is gonna get interesting.

639
00:39:31,775 --> 00:39:37,675
I think that it would be a wonderful
idea to get a warlock in here.

640
00:39:37,949 --> 00:39:40,265
Now, that's a male witch.

641
00:39:40,266 --> 00:39:44,202
This needs to be a male
witch who's very masculine.

642
00:39:44,203 --> 00:39:48,169
The first thing that this individual
would do is a banishment ritual

643
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:54,070
to rid him and send him to where
he belongs, which I believe is hell.

644
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,109
So why does it have to be a
masculine male witch or warlock?

645
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:00,552
Because this...

646
00:40:00,553 --> 00:40:03,973
Entity is intimidated by...

647
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,559
Males who are masculine.

648
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,662
And I think it's intimidated by you.

649
00:40:10,663 --> 00:40:15,848
That's why he picks on
women, because he's a coward.

650
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:18,606
So is this thing a Demon?

651
00:40:18,607 --> 00:40:20,467
Yes.

652
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,247
Shaela, how are you
feeling about all this?

653
00:40:24,248 --> 00:40:26,090
It's just um...

654
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:29,568
Just a little... kind of
just overwhelmed, I guess.

655
00:40:29,569 --> 00:40:31,055
What about this guy in the garage?

656
00:40:31,056 --> 00:40:34,856
My one suggestion is
to have a very short.

657
00:40:34,857 --> 00:40:38,385
To-the-point
conversation with him.

658
00:40:38,386 --> 00:40:43,135
Let him know that you know who
he is, you know that he's there.

659
00:40:43,136 --> 00:40:47,851
You know what he wants, and that
you're basically fine with that

660
00:40:47,852 --> 00:40:52,504
and to give him the time and space
for him to work his issues out.

661
00:40:52,505 --> 00:40:56,905
As long as he doesn't
bother you or your family.

662
00:40:56,906 --> 00:40:58,510
What about the antique guns?

663
00:40:58,511 --> 00:41:01,245
You need to cleanse the antiques.

664
00:41:01,246 --> 00:41:02,645
Okay.

665
00:41:02,646 --> 00:41:06,084
And the way that I would do this
is just a real basic cleansing...

666
00:41:06,085 --> 00:41:10,833
Is to have some holy water, get it on
the rag, dry out the rag really well.

667
00:41:10,834 --> 00:41:14,140
And just, you know, rub down
the items and just ask God,

668
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:17,662
to remove the negative energy
and/or person from the item.

669
00:41:17,663 --> 00:41:21,110
So, by doing that with the
old stuff he's got and...

670
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:23,812
Wiping it down, would
that get that tired...

671
00:41:23,813 --> 00:41:29,033
Yes. That'll help a bit
with the draining feeling.

672
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,842
Now, I want youse all to look
me in the eye and promise me

673
00:41:31,843 --> 00:41:34,590
you're gonna listen to Amy's
advice and do what she tells you.

674
00:41:34,591 --> 00:41:37,445
- Yep. 100%.
- Okay.

675
00:41:37,446 --> 00:41:40,218
You have my word on it. Otherwise,
I wouldn't have called you.

676
00:41:40,219 --> 00:41:41,219
Okay.

677
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,746
- Shaela?
- Yeah, totally.

678
00:41:42,747 --> 00:41:44,789
I definitely want to get
rid of what's in the house.

679
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,710
Okay.

680
00:41:46,729 --> 00:41:50,028
There are several dead
people on Mark's property.

681
00:41:50,029 --> 00:41:53,710
But the evil black mass
poses the greatest threat.

682
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:56,493
I'm worried that if they
don't deal with it immediately,

683
00:41:56,494 --> 00:42:00,628
their suffering could continue,
and they might never find peace.
