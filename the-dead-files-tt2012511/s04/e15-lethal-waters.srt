1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:11,767 --> 00:00:14,670
She knows she's freaking scaring them.

3
00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:16,707
There's something here.

4
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:19,876
I can hear footsteps walking behind me.

5
00:00:19,877 --> 00:00:21,878
You can feel that you're being watched.

6
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:24,854
She had been stabbed and hacked.

7
00:00:24,855 --> 00:00:26,216
He killed her.

8
00:00:26,217 --> 00:00:27,718
I'm not gonna walk away.

9
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:30,719
She's inside of me.

10
00:00:31,362 --> 00:00:36,025
This is going to be a
difficult walk for me.

11
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:38,454
They're being watched.

12
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:41,362
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:41,363 --> 00:00:43,613
This thing likes death.

14
00:00:43,614 --> 00:00:45,224
I see dead people.

15
00:00:45,225 --> 00:00:46,784
This thing is, like, a monster.

16
00:00:46,785 --> 00:00:49,034
I speak to dead people.

17
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:50,566
And he's pissed off now.

18
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:52,053
And they speak to me.

19
00:00:52,054 --> 00:00:53,664
His head was cracked.

20
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:56,809
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

21
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,701
This guy was murdered.

22
00:00:58,702 --> 00:01:00,120
I rely on my partner.

23
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:03,475
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

24
00:01:03,476 --> 00:01:06,193
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

25
00:01:06,194 --> 00:01:09,286
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:09,287 --> 00:01:12,199
You saw her? It's my job to reveal them.

27
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,352
Why would you stay here?

28
00:01:13,353 --> 00:01:15,476
But Steve and I never speak...

29
00:01:15,477 --> 00:01:17,460
We never communicate
during an investigation.

30
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:18,872
Until the very end.

31
00:01:18,873 --> 00:01:20,646
Stop it.

32
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,810
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

33
00:01:22,811 --> 00:01:25,216
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

34
00:01:25,217 --> 00:01:26,571
Or time to get out.

35
00:01:26,572 --> 00:01:31,312
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

36
00:01:47,334 --> 00:01:49,450
Amy and I are called
in to investigate cases,

37
00:01:49,451 --> 00:01:52,525
when our clients have
nowhere else to turn.

38
00:01:52,526 --> 00:01:55,826
I interview living witnesses and
dig into the history of the location.

39
00:01:55,827 --> 00:01:59,244
Looking for secrets buried in the past.

40
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:03,385
While Amy communicates with the dead.

41
00:02:04,155 --> 00:02:06,156
I'm in Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania.

42
00:02:06,157 --> 00:02:09,006
It's about 100 miles
north of Pittsburgh.

43
00:02:09,007 --> 00:02:13,763
I received a call from a woman
named Brenda, who owns a local hotel.

44
00:02:13,764 --> 00:02:16,937
She says things have gotten so
bad that her employees are scared,

45
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:19,343
and her guests are having
terrible experiences.

46
00:02:19,344 --> 00:02:24,864
She says if we can't help,
she may lose her business.

47
00:02:28,294 --> 00:02:33,441
Before Amy arrives, I look for anything
that could influence her findings.

48
00:02:33,442 --> 00:02:35,607
This hotel is filled with
historical photographs,

49
00:02:35,608 --> 00:02:39,688
that have to be covered or removed.

50
00:02:40,124 --> 00:02:46,024
When I'm finished, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

51
00:03:04,515 --> 00:03:07,485
This is going to be a
difficult walk for me.

52
00:03:07,486 --> 00:03:10,420
I feel dizzy and...

53
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:13,204
Confused... very confused.

54
00:03:13,205 --> 00:03:16,505
There's a lot of death.

55
00:03:29,096 --> 00:03:31,687
Someone did suffer...

56
00:03:31,688 --> 00:03:34,868
Major head trauma here.

57
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,570
It was agony... absolutely just agony.

58
00:03:40,585 --> 00:03:42,385
Mm.

59
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,537
- Brenda?
- Yes.

60
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:57,134
Very glad you're here.

61
00:03:57,135 --> 00:04:00,609
- How long you owned this place?
- This is the beginning of our fourth year.

62
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:06,229
Way back in 1986, my husband and I pulled
up in front of the hotel, and we said...

63
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,248
"Man, if we ever won the lottery,
I would want to buy the Inn".

64
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,515
Um, about four years ago,
the opportunity arose.

65
00:04:12,516 --> 00:04:15,652
Didn't win the lottery, but we sank
every penny we have into the place.

66
00:04:15,653 --> 00:04:18,678
So, at what point did you
realize you have a problem here?

67
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:20,719
Well, after we talked
to some of the employees

68
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,584
that had worked here over the years.

69
00:04:22,585 --> 00:04:25,169
I realized that we had a couple
that were afraid to work in

70
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,465
the dish room by themselves
because they had seen things.

71
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:32,746
Talking to different customers, I realized
that there are a lot of things going on.

72
00:04:32,747 --> 00:04:37,707
People being touched, things
disappearing out of the dinner theater.

73
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,309
Quite a few things.

74
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,411
- Is it hurting business?
- Absolutely.

75
00:04:41,412 --> 00:04:44,460
Nobody wants to go into a
hotel that they don't feel safe.

76
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:47,788
One guest leaves here saying,
oh, something happened in my room.

77
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:48,885
He tells 10 other people.

78
00:04:48,886 --> 00:04:53,314
I think there are people that
really would be afraid to...

79
00:04:53,315 --> 00:04:56,542
Come and stay at a place
that they think is "haunted".

80
00:04:56,543 --> 00:05:00,958
My main concern is that this inn
stays here for the next hundred years.

81
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,020
And you got how much savings
invested in this place?

82
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:04,267
Everything.

83
00:05:04,268 --> 00:05:10,028
- So, for you to shut it down would...
- I'd go bankrupt.

84
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:18,530
There's a lot of inner conflict
with the dead people here.

85
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:24,619
There's a lot of issues
between them, a lot of fighting.

86
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,536
There's even, like, cliques.

87
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:31,682
I'd say there's about three
cliques of dead people here.

88
00:05:31,683 --> 00:05:34,803
And they fight a lot.

89
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,117
The entities here are
so angry with each other,

90
00:05:41,118 --> 00:05:44,158
they are separating themselves
into three warring groups...

91
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,660
The old people, the young people...

92
00:05:46,661 --> 00:05:51,178
And this third group that I can only
describe as juvenile delinquents.

93
00:05:51,179 --> 00:05:53,811
There's this old man here with a cane.

94
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,720
He's a very dominant presence.

95
00:05:56,721 --> 00:06:01,379
He has a beard and mustache,
which are gray and white.

96
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:07,280
And he beats the younger people
with his cane when they fight.

97
00:06:07,495 --> 00:06:11,534
The living actually
can hear or feel this.

98
00:06:11,535 --> 00:06:15,495
It would be really scary to them.

99
00:06:21,544 --> 00:06:25,726
Brenda, this is a pretty interesting part
of the hotel, why'd you bring me in here?

100
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:29,067
This is where at one point in
time, my husband and I came up,

101
00:06:29,068 --> 00:06:32,407
and the lights flickered, doors slammed,
and we were the only people in the hotel.

102
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:34,335
Okay, did the breaker go
or something like that?

103
00:06:34,336 --> 00:06:37,223
Nope. Nope. Not at all. We flipped
the lights off, flipped the lights on.

104
00:06:37,224 --> 00:06:39,953
- They'd come back on again.
- Anything else going on up here?

105
00:06:39,954 --> 00:06:43,351
Well, when I come up here
myself, I always feel watched.

106
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:48,291
Just a general feeling of
eyes being on you like...

107
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:53,962
Whoever or whatever might be sitting in one
of these chairs just watching you pass by.

108
00:06:53,963 --> 00:06:55,345
Do you feel that way now?

109
00:06:55,346 --> 00:07:01,246
I always have that feeling that
there's always somebody watching me.

110
00:07:08,397 --> 00:07:13,497
These are where the juvenile
delinquents hang out.

111
00:07:17,786 --> 00:07:22,106
They are plotting and planning in here.

112
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:31,032
There's at least five kids, and
they like to watch living people.

113
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:35,306
They're like little spies creeping
around and watching people.

114
00:07:35,307 --> 00:07:38,191
You know, a little
inappropriate behavior.

115
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:40,472
Like what?

116
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:46,009
Like shower watching or
people going to the bathroom.

117
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:53,097
Do you know anything about
the history of this place?

118
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,436
Back in the turn of the century,
it was known as a resort,

119
00:07:55,437 --> 00:07:56,841
kind of like a Fountain of Youth.

120
00:07:56,842 --> 00:07:58,928
Okay, my question to you is,

121
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:03,284
what if Amy told you that it's not
safe for your guests to be here?

122
00:08:03,285 --> 00:08:05,206
I have no idea what we would do.

123
00:08:05,207 --> 00:08:07,120
I really, really don't.

124
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:09,908
- Okay, she may tell you that.
- I know.

125
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:11,273
Okay?

126
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:14,196
I know you got your heart
and soul in this place.

127
00:08:14,197 --> 00:08:16,237
We do.

128
00:08:17,973 --> 00:08:20,680
Everything we have is right here.

129
00:08:20,681 --> 00:08:24,041
I'm not gonna walk away.

130
00:08:34,202 --> 00:08:37,503
Larry, I was talking to your wife, and she
said that you've been experiencing stuff

131
00:08:37,504 --> 00:08:40,235
down here in the theater.

132
00:08:40,236 --> 00:08:42,836
You can feel that you're being watched.

133
00:08:42,837 --> 00:08:46,600
In what way, like, somebody's peeking
around the corner at you, or actually just

134
00:08:46,601 --> 00:08:48,609
like, sitting next to you, watching you?

135
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,802
Like maybe just sitting, watching
you, or standing there watching.

136
00:08:52,803 --> 00:08:54,549
It can be disturbing.

137
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,808
Anything else going on?

138
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:57,752
Mostly things disappearing here.

139
00:08:57,753 --> 00:08:59,160
Like what?

140
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:03,912
Props, shoes. They disappear for
two weeks, and then they reappear.

141
00:09:03,913 --> 00:09:06,890
You sure it's nobody borrowing
this stuff and bringing it back?

142
00:09:06,891 --> 00:09:09,500
Positive, because I have the key.

143
00:09:09,501 --> 00:09:13,951
I personally had a costume
go missing backstage...

144
00:09:13,952 --> 00:09:17,954
And three months later, it
appeared at the front desk.

145
00:09:17,955 --> 00:09:22,575
And nobody could
explain how it got there.

146
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:29,036
The younger people are
far more rambunctious...

147
00:09:29,037 --> 00:09:32,290
And angry than the old people.

148
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,152
They get all pissy.

149
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:37,984
They work each other up,
and then they run amok.

150
00:09:37,985 --> 00:09:40,730
So, to the living
people, it seems constant.

151
00:09:40,731 --> 00:09:45,411
There's always something
that's been moved.

152
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,719
Like what?

153
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,742
Uh, anything and everything, really.

154
00:09:51,743 --> 00:09:54,745
So, what else have you seen?

155
00:09:54,746 --> 00:09:58,582
Lights that turn on
and off by themselves.

156
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:02,220
The building is locked in
the winter when we're closed.

157
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:06,596
I've had people call and say there
are lights on on the third floor.

158
00:10:06,597 --> 00:10:08,550
I, myself, have come over,

159
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:11,896
unlocked the building, gone
upstairs, the light is not on.

160
00:10:11,897 --> 00:10:14,063
You sure it's nobody
breaking in, the kids doing...

161
00:10:14,064 --> 00:10:16,133
I want to find a ghost
here or something like that?

162
00:10:16,134 --> 00:10:18,506
Uh, security cameras show nothing.

163
00:10:18,507 --> 00:10:23,961
And we've had the electrical checked, and
there's no problem with the electrical.

164
00:10:23,962 --> 00:10:26,316
I got to ask you a
question... if Amy tells you,

165
00:10:26,317 --> 00:10:29,914
that it's not safe for your guests
to be here, what are you gonna do?

166
00:10:29,915 --> 00:10:32,130
That would be crushing.

167
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,718
This has been a lifelong dream for us.

168
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:39,159
We've invested our life savings into it.

169
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,940
And then, with the kids,
the juvenile delinquents.

170
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:47,501
They are fascinated with,
like, equipment and, like,

171
00:10:47,502 --> 00:10:52,182
electronic issues, like,
with the television.

172
00:10:54,272 --> 00:10:56,921
I don't know yet about them.

173
00:10:56,922 --> 00:11:00,702
I think they're the bad seeds.

174
00:11:22,563 --> 00:11:24,709
- Kristi, I was talking to Brenda.
- Mm hmm.

175
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,174
- How long you been working here?
- Nine years.

176
00:11:27,175 --> 00:11:29,364
Now, she told me that you've
had some experiences here?

177
00:11:29,365 --> 00:11:30,264
Yes.

178
00:11:30,265 --> 00:11:35,670
I'll be leaving here, and as I'm walking,
I can hear footsteps walking behind me.

179
00:11:35,671 --> 00:11:37,522
- And nobody else is in the hotel.
- Unh-unh.

180
00:11:37,523 --> 00:11:39,356
And how far behind you do you hear it?

181
00:11:39,357 --> 00:11:42,225
I turn around to see if they're right
there, that's how close it sounds.

182
00:11:42,226 --> 00:11:43,680
- That's how close?
- Yes.

183
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:45,609
Have you experienced anything else?

184
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,391
In this room, I was
meeting with a bride.

185
00:11:48,392 --> 00:11:51,231
It was in the middle of the
winter, so there was nobody here.

186
00:11:51,232 --> 00:11:54,535
And she goes, I see somebody
walking down the hall.

187
00:11:54,536 --> 00:11:56,734
And I go, really? The doors are locked.

188
00:11:56,735 --> 00:11:59,948
So I turned around, and
we both see this shadow.

189
00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:03,451
Went and looked out this
door, and we saw nobody.

190
00:12:03,452 --> 00:12:04,941
Okay.

191
00:12:04,942 --> 00:12:07,445
- Did it look like a human being walking?
- Yes.

192
00:12:07,446 --> 00:12:09,707
Okay, so, it didn't look
like a mist or anything?

193
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,508
No.

194
00:12:11,571 --> 00:12:15,286
Okay. These things that are going on
here, is it hurting business at all?

195
00:12:15,287 --> 00:12:18,911
I have a couple brides that are leery.

196
00:12:18,912 --> 00:12:20,927
Why do you stay here?

197
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:23,329
I love my job. I love the hotel.

198
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:27,033
Now, Brenda was saying how she put
her life savings into this place.

199
00:12:27,034 --> 00:12:31,894
- Are you worried about her?
- Yes. Very much.

200
00:12:36,243 --> 00:12:38,497
You said there were three cliques?

201
00:12:38,498 --> 00:12:40,166
Yes.

202
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:42,044
Would they be seen at all?

203
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:46,186
It's possible that
the elderly people are.

204
00:12:46,187 --> 00:12:50,093
But the kids, I would
think that maybe people...

205
00:12:50,094 --> 00:12:55,994
Could possibly see them, just because
they're all about spying and hiding.

206
00:12:58,231 --> 00:13:00,151
Um...

207
00:13:01,442 --> 00:13:03,782
So, like...

208
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:07,471
There's a lot of people
who are unhappy here.

209
00:13:07,472 --> 00:13:12,009
And then the living people
have negative experiences.

210
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:15,550
And kind of become negative.

211
00:13:24,072 --> 00:13:26,295
So, Marie, I was talking
to your sister, Brenda,

212
00:13:26,296 --> 00:13:28,327
and she said that you've
had some experiences here?

213
00:13:28,328 --> 00:13:29,160
Yes.

214
00:13:29,161 --> 00:13:30,977
Okay. Can you explain
some of them for me?

215
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:34,529
I've spent nights where my sister
and I were the only ones in-house.

216
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:39,138
And I hear, like, what is heavy
furniture being pulled across the floor.

217
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:41,702
And the one night, we're
up on the third floor.

218
00:13:41,703 --> 00:13:44,803
Well, there's nothing above
us on the third floor, but yet,

219
00:13:44,804 --> 00:13:46,560
I could still hear that noise.

220
00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:49,315
- Does it wake you up?
- It has, yes.

221
00:13:49,316 --> 00:13:51,358
- Okay, so it's that loud?
- Mm hmm.

222
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:52,825
What else have you experienced?

223
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:54,601
We were checking curtains in rooms,

224
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:57,868
and Brenda and Pat, my
other sister, was in front.

225
00:13:57,869 --> 00:13:59,858
And I felt a tug on my shirt.

226
00:13:59,859 --> 00:14:02,367
And I turned around.
There's nobody there.

227
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:03,741
You didn't get caught on anything?

228
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:06,532
No. I was right in
the middle of the hall.

229
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:08,034
Anything else?

230
00:14:08,035 --> 00:14:11,529
Uh, one night, in one
of the rooms, Pat and I,

231
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,778
she was in one bed and I was
in one bed next to the door.

232
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:17,564
And it was probably 5:00
or 6:00 in the morning,

233
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:21,772
and I heard, like, a key in the door.

234
00:14:21,773 --> 00:14:23,361
And that's what woke me.

235
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,600
But nobody came in, so I thought,
oh, somebody just has the wrong door.

236
00:14:26,601 --> 00:14:27,920
Okay.

237
00:14:27,921 --> 00:14:31,875
And then it wasn't even
like 15 seconds later...

238
00:14:31,876 --> 00:14:35,861
The sheets and blankets raise
up above where I'm sleeping.

239
00:14:35,862 --> 00:14:41,762
And then I feel this weight, like
someone's laying right on top of me.

240
00:14:42,108 --> 00:14:44,438
I was... I was scared to death.

241
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:49,681
I tried to wake up Pat, but when you're
that scared, nothing will come out.

242
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:53,669
It's like you can't
get your voice to work.

243
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,848
It was terrifying. I
couldn't go back to sleep.

244
00:14:56,849 --> 00:15:00,373
Well, let me ask you a question. Have you
ever experienced anything before the hotel?

245
00:15:00,374 --> 00:15:03,679
No. I've never been
a believer in ghosts.

246
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,560
Then that happened. It's like,
okay, there's something here.

247
00:15:13,754 --> 00:15:18,517
There's two women in particular
who do a lot of screaming.

248
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:21,722
One of them is very depressed.

249
00:15:21,723 --> 00:15:24,423
And she is mad.

250
00:15:24,503 --> 00:15:28,583
And she is always dressed in black.

251
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:35,162
This is, like, her zone.

252
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:39,189
This is, I think, where she's seen...

253
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:44,410
The most and has the most
interactions with people.

254
00:15:46,085 --> 00:15:49,745
Everything she does is creepy.

255
00:15:50,258 --> 00:15:53,618
She has a violent temper.

256
00:16:07,517 --> 00:16:11,777
Brenda told me that her hotel was
once marketed as the Fountain of Youth.

257
00:16:11,778 --> 00:16:13,781
So I'm heading over to
meet with a local historian,

258
00:16:13,782 --> 00:16:19,682
who said that what happened at the
Riverside will definitely help my case.

259
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,684
So, my client said that the
property I'm investigating

260
00:16:29,685 --> 00:16:32,208
might have been a
fountain-of-youth type of a place.

261
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:34,597
- It was.
- Okay. Now, who owned the property?

262
00:16:34,598 --> 00:16:39,271
Well, that was Dr. John H. Gray.
He's in the photograph here.

263
00:16:39,272 --> 00:16:41,246
He was the one that
discovered the mineral waters.

264
00:16:41,247 --> 00:16:44,019
He was out probing, looking
for oil on his property.

265
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,477
He discovered not oil,
but rather a spring.

266
00:16:47,478 --> 00:16:51,010
So he had it tested, found
it was high in iron, sodium...

267
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:54,963
Uh, magnesium, potassium, quite
a long list of minerals there.

268
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:58,179
So, he starts prescribing to the locals.

269
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,280
Here's an advertisement
here that is promoting

270
00:17:00,281 --> 00:17:04,721
what was available
for these individuals.

271
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:09,209
So, Dr. Gray thought this water
could cure just about anything?

272
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,380
That seemed to be the idea.

273
00:17:11,381 --> 00:17:14,024
Dale, this guy sounds
like some kind of a quack.

274
00:17:14,025 --> 00:17:17,743
Well, it does seem like quackery
by today's medical sciences.

275
00:17:17,744 --> 00:17:22,964
But that's what people
believed back at that time.

276
00:17:24,727 --> 00:17:28,267
Something is not right here.

277
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,099
This used to be nicer grounds.

278
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,915
More...

279
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,908
Lush...

280
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:40,489
Bigger gardens.

281
00:17:41,545 --> 00:17:45,505
And there's, like, this wetness...

282
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:49,368
Like oil or...

283
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,349
Water.

284
00:17:54,051 --> 00:17:58,549
And it looks really
nice, but it's, uh...

285
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:02,270
Not. It caused the misfortunes.

286
00:18:02,865 --> 00:18:06,825
And then I do hear "convalescent"?

287
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,801
It's very...

288
00:18:09,802 --> 00:18:11,902
Strange.

289
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:17,067
When did he start treating
people with this mineral water?

290
00:18:17,068 --> 00:18:18,602
It was 1884.

291
00:18:18,603 --> 00:18:22,525
This is a photograph that shows a
large number of people at the original,

292
00:18:22,526 --> 00:18:25,636
Gray Mineral spring house.

293
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:29,615
People would stand 100 people in a
line waiting to buy a glass of water...

294
00:18:29,616 --> 00:18:33,307
Take a seat, drink their water, get
back in line, and do it all over again.

295
00:18:33,308 --> 00:18:35,669
Okay. What kind of people went to him?

296
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,682
A lot of these people would have come
with pre-existing medical conditions.

297
00:18:38,683 --> 00:18:44,583
Everything from gout and diabetes
to disorders of the stomach, kidneys.

298
00:18:44,586 --> 00:18:47,406
Okay, so, did anybody
get cured from this stuff?

299
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:49,955
There were those that
believed that they were better.

300
00:18:49,956 --> 00:18:52,581
But we're seeing that large
amounts of magnesium...

301
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:56,873
Uh, can actually lead to serious issues
to the point of even death for some.

302
00:18:56,874 --> 00:19:01,097
All right, so, do we know if anybody
died at the property I'm investigating?

303
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,853
Well, there were about six.

304
00:19:03,854 --> 00:19:06,099
Now, did Gray get in
any trouble for this?

305
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,786
Actually, no. Um, he
lost the hotel in 1890.

306
00:19:09,787 --> 00:19:15,187
They got behind on taxes,
and a year later, he died.

307
00:19:21,832 --> 00:19:26,833
It seems like this place
did serve a lot of purpose.

308
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:28,178
What do you mean?

309
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:33,823
There's, like, people coming
and going and coming and going.

310
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:37,544
I literally see, like, gurneys?

311
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:50,200
I think that there were
a lot of ill people here.

312
00:19:51,655 --> 00:19:53,243
You okay?

313
00:19:53,244 --> 00:19:55,612
I just feel sick.

314
00:19:55,613 --> 00:19:58,613
I'm a [Bleep] mess.

315
00:19:59,651 --> 00:20:01,953
Dale told me that the
waters at the Riverside,

316
00:20:01,954 --> 00:20:04,921
could have done a lot
more harm than good.

317
00:20:04,922 --> 00:20:09,152
I need to find out what a heavy dose
of magnesium will do to the human body.

318
00:20:09,153 --> 00:20:11,240
So I've called on a
Physiology Professor,

319
00:20:11,241 --> 00:20:17,141
who says the cure could've been
a lot worse than the disease.

320
00:20:24,688 --> 00:20:26,958
The property I'm investigating,
apparently, at one time,

321
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:30,503
there was a Dr. Gray there that
ran it as a Fountain of Youth,

322
00:20:30,504 --> 00:20:32,727
where the mineral water that
was filled with magnesium,

323
00:20:32,728 --> 00:20:34,648
he said, would cure all diseases.

324
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:36,922
Now, is there any truth at all to that?

325
00:20:36,923 --> 00:20:39,131
No, absolutely not.

326
00:20:39,132 --> 00:20:41,226
It would seem like
to me, even back then,

327
00:20:41,227 --> 00:20:44,411
that this would still be an
outrageous claim to treat illnesses.

328
00:20:44,412 --> 00:20:46,000
Okay.

329
00:20:46,001 --> 00:20:48,522
This is one of the bottles
I was actually able to find,

330
00:20:48,523 --> 00:20:52,363
that was being sold at the Inn.

331
00:20:54,305 --> 00:20:58,174
So, what would the symptoms be if
somebody had too much magnesium in them?

332
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:01,111
Well, things like nausea,
dizziness, flushing.

333
00:21:01,112 --> 00:21:02,343
Okay.

334
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,692
Now, I understand there were
six deaths at the location.

335
00:21:05,693 --> 00:21:06,544
Okay.

336
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:09,368
Could too much of the
mineral water kill somebody?

337
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:14,886
With the levels of magnesium that
are in that water, it's possible.

338
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:19,691
Now, were there any diseases that would've
been worsened by taking this stuff?

339
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:23,813
Certainly. If they had diminished
kidney function or kidney disease...

340
00:21:23,814 --> 00:21:26,272
Or stomach issues.

341
00:21:26,273 --> 00:21:28,473
Then, if it got to be high
enough amounts of magnesium,

342
00:21:28,474 --> 00:21:34,374
it could be respiratory failure and
cardiac arrest, in the worst-case scenario.

343
00:21:36,681 --> 00:21:41,541
There's a lot of physical
pain in this area.

344
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,550
It hurts.

345
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:55,623
People are crying out in pain.

346
00:21:55,624 --> 00:21:57,323
Really...

347
00:21:57,324 --> 00:21:58,802
Sick.

348
00:21:58,803 --> 00:22:01,983
Very much illness here.

349
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:06,114
I feel like lots of breathing problems.

350
00:22:06,115 --> 00:22:08,876
Like people might have some...

351
00:22:08,877 --> 00:22:11,037
Seizures.

352
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,600
[Bleep]

353
00:22:15,624 --> 00:22:17,153
Ugh.

354
00:22:17,154 --> 00:22:21,594
I can't even, like, talk. Like, it's...

355
00:22:42,346 --> 00:22:48,246
I'm at the local library to see what else
I can uncover about the property's past.

356
00:22:51,045 --> 00:22:52,987
While looking through
newspaper archives,

357
00:22:52,988 --> 00:22:58,888
I discover a drowning that
occurred right on the hotel grounds.

358
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:06,846
Now that I know that a kid died right
in the creek on my client's property,

359
00:23:06,847 --> 00:23:09,061
I need to find out what happened.

360
00:23:09,062 --> 00:23:11,465
I'm on my way to meet
with a local crime writer,

361
00:23:11,466 --> 00:23:17,366
who says that tragedy is one of
several that hit the Riverside.

362
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:29,457
I came across this kid that drowned right
here on the property I'm investigating.

363
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,466
- Yes.
- What can you tell me about that?

364
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:34,774
That happened in August of 1979.

365
00:23:34,775 --> 00:23:35,654
Okay.

366
00:23:35,655 --> 00:23:38,263
Young man's name was Robert Griffith.

367
00:23:38,264 --> 00:23:39,636
Here you go.

368
00:23:39,637 --> 00:23:42,435
He was swimming with some
friends in the river here,

369
00:23:42,436 --> 00:23:46,147
and was taken under and drowned.

370
00:23:46,148 --> 00:23:47,666
All right. So, this was an accident?

371
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:50,758
It was an accident, yeah. And they...

372
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:54,249
Were kind of common in French
Creek, as a matter of fact.

373
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,568
What do you mean by common?

374
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:59,453
Well, there was a young man who drowned
in the river almost in the same spot.

375
00:23:59,454 --> 00:24:02,221
The very next year. His
name was Michael Catalano.

376
00:24:02,222 --> 00:24:05,068
And I happened to find a
picture of him here for you.

377
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:07,544
Uh, it was similar circumstances.

378
00:24:07,545 --> 00:24:11,234
He was in swimming and
was taken under and uh...

379
00:24:11,235 --> 00:24:13,741
- And drowned.
- Now, is the river that bad?

380
00:24:13,742 --> 00:24:16,039
Well, the river is kind of deceptive.

381
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,997
It looks calm, but it runs deep.

382
00:24:18,998 --> 00:24:23,061
There's a lot of current in it
to trip you up and pull you under.

383
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:28,962
French Creek has taken a lot
of lives up and down its length.

384
00:24:38,918 --> 00:24:42,878
There's some people in the water.

385
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:48,046
They're bloated. I think they're dead.

386
00:24:48,047 --> 00:24:53,338
And there's a woman, this mournful
woman, and she's desperate.

387
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:55,701
She likes to jump people.

388
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,553
She wants to make
people go in the water.

389
00:24:58,554 --> 00:25:02,506
Would you say this depressed
woman by the river is dangerous?

390
00:25:02,507 --> 00:25:03,909
Yes.

391
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,624
She's, um...

392
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:08,193
Trying to get me to go in the water.

393
00:25:08,194 --> 00:25:11,734
Can you describe it at all?

394
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:14,152
She's in me.

395
00:25:14,153 --> 00:25:17,093
Well, inside of me.

396
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:20,515
So, Don, I've exhausted,

397
00:25:20,516 --> 00:25:23,376
about everything I can investigating
the location, but you had mentioned

398
00:25:23,377 --> 00:25:26,390
on the phone that there were some
other things that might help my case?

399
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:31,045
You might be interested
in the Doris Hatch case.

400
00:25:31,046 --> 00:25:34,948
- What year was this?
- It was the summer of 1953.

401
00:25:34,949 --> 00:25:40,589
Doris lived literally two
minutes away from here, walking.

402
00:25:40,728 --> 00:25:41,634
Okay.

403
00:25:41,635 --> 00:25:45,775
She was a young lady, 22 years old.

404
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:47,394
Um...

405
00:25:47,395 --> 00:25:51,496
She worked as a bookkeeper
for a local hardware store.

406
00:25:51,497 --> 00:25:52,815
Okay, so, what happened to her?

407
00:25:52,816 --> 00:25:58,036
She stepped out of the
hardware store and vanished.

408
00:25:58,045 --> 00:26:00,680
Police, once they started investigating,

409
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:06,140
settled pretty quickly on a
suspect for her disappearance.

410
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:10,415
And that was William Turner,
her boss at the hardware store.

411
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:12,339
He's 33.

412
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:17,283
The day that Doris vanished,
Turner took a business trip.

413
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:20,660
He was very evasive when he
was questioned by authorities,

414
00:26:20,661 --> 00:26:23,574
as to what that business trip entailed.

415
00:26:23,575 --> 00:26:26,704
Was there any motive behind why
she would have been murdered?

416
00:26:26,705 --> 00:26:29,753
There were persistent rumors
that they were seeing each other,

417
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:33,246
there was some sort of a romantic
relationship between them.

418
00:26:33,247 --> 00:26:36,109
Don, how long was it before
the body was discovered?

419
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:39,200
Two 1/2 years later, a
hunter found the body.

420
00:26:39,201 --> 00:26:44,822
She had been stabbed and hacked with
a large bladed weapon, like a machete.

421
00:26:44,823 --> 00:26:47,192
He was tipped off...

422
00:26:47,193 --> 00:26:51,327
To the authorities finding
the body by an Erie newspaper.

423
00:26:51,328 --> 00:26:56,434
And told his wife that he was gonna come
back to Crawford County to clear his name.

424
00:26:56,435 --> 00:26:58,598
Then he took a walk to clear his head.

425
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:02,183
And when police moved in to
arrest him, he wasn't at home.

426
00:27:02,184 --> 00:27:06,601
They found him propped up against the sea
wall looking out at the Atlantic Ocean.

427
00:27:06,602 --> 00:27:10,100
Dead from a self-inflicted
gunshot wound to the chest.

428
00:27:10,101 --> 00:27:13,085
Did either one of these
people frequent this hotel?

429
00:27:13,086 --> 00:27:16,547
I would say without a doubt,
they have been at the Riverside.

430
00:27:16,548 --> 00:27:21,752
The Riverside, at the time, was a place
for weddings, dinners, Christmas parties.

431
00:27:21,753 --> 00:27:25,953
All that type of thing happened here.

432
00:27:27,466 --> 00:27:32,686
I think there was a dude
who killed a chick here.

433
00:27:36,442 --> 00:27:38,810
It's like there... there...
there was, like, a fight.

434
00:27:38,811 --> 00:27:42,051
They're fighting a lot.

435
00:27:45,318 --> 00:27:47,585
So he killed her. He strangled her.

436
00:27:47,586 --> 00:27:50,225
She says that's what ended her life.

437
00:27:50,226 --> 00:27:52,831
He also seems much older than her.

438
00:27:52,832 --> 00:27:54,665
They were intimate.

439
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:59,439
She thinks he had it planned out,
like he was gonna murder her anyways.

440
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,400
Like, I'm... hearing them arguing.

441
00:28:03,461 --> 00:28:06,614
And then she's on the floor...

442
00:28:06,615 --> 00:28:09,767
And he's got his knee in her chest.

443
00:28:09,768 --> 00:28:12,572
Like, really squeezing it.

444
00:28:12,573 --> 00:28:15,993
He wants her out of here.

445
00:28:20,586 --> 00:28:23,583
I encountered dozens
of entities on my walk.

446
00:28:23,584 --> 00:28:25,886
He's probably about...

447
00:28:25,887 --> 00:28:28,407
75 years old.

448
00:28:29,728 --> 00:28:32,772
But the leader of the older
clique was the most prominent.

449
00:28:32,773 --> 00:28:35,103
So I decided to sketch him.

450
00:28:35,104 --> 00:28:36,737
He has a cane.

451
00:28:36,738 --> 00:28:39,949
He has a mustache and a beard.

452
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:44,090
And he has very light, intense eyes.

453
00:28:47,979 --> 00:28:51,039
Is this who you saw?

454
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,230
Yes.

455
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:21,632
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations...

456
00:29:21,633 --> 00:29:24,557
We're ready to reveal our
findings to our clients,

457
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:28,578
and each other for the first time.

458
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:31,006
Amy, I want you to
meet Larry and Brenda.

459
00:29:31,007 --> 00:29:32,922
They're a married couple.

460
00:29:32,923 --> 00:29:36,114
Their dream was to own the hotel.

461
00:29:36,115 --> 00:29:40,129
And a few years back they actually obtained
that dream, but it came with a price.

462
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:45,365
The activity's so bad here that the guests
and their employees are scared to be here.

463
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,663
They're afraid that if we
can't help and figure out what's

464
00:29:47,664 --> 00:29:51,240
going on in this place, they
might have to lose the business.

465
00:29:51,241 --> 00:29:54,455
With that, I'm gonna ask Amy to
tell us a little bit about her walk.

466
00:29:54,456 --> 00:29:57,936
And see what she uncovered.

467
00:29:59,249 --> 00:30:02,780
I was out on the grounds,
and I felt like I was...

468
00:30:02,781 --> 00:30:05,185
Seeing this substance.

469
00:30:05,186 --> 00:30:08,758
But I didn't know if it
was oil or water or both.

470
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:13,505
I felt like it had
caused a lot of problems.

471
00:30:13,506 --> 00:30:16,926
And that it's still here.

472
00:30:16,967 --> 00:30:18,334
That's interesting.

473
00:30:18,335 --> 00:30:20,588
The original owner of the property...

474
00:30:20,589 --> 00:30:23,706
And of the hotel itself was
a guy by the name of Dr. Gray.

475
00:30:23,707 --> 00:30:25,474
This is Dr. Gray here.

476
00:30:25,475 --> 00:30:27,275
Mm.

477
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:29,733
Interesting.

478
00:30:29,734 --> 00:30:34,423
Back in 1859, when he acquired the
property, he started looking for oil.

479
00:30:34,424 --> 00:30:36,924
But what he did discover
was mineral water.

480
00:30:36,925 --> 00:30:38,327
Oh.

481
00:30:38,328 --> 00:30:41,530
And he found out there were
high levels of magnesium in it.

482
00:30:41,531 --> 00:30:47,336
He decided that, with the mineral water, to
make this place into a wellness Sanitarium.

483
00:30:47,337 --> 00:30:49,497
Oh, wow.

484
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,862
Here's a picture of what
it looked like back then.

485
00:30:54,863 --> 00:30:59,615
Interesting, because I
heard the word convalescent.

486
00:30:59,616 --> 00:31:01,673
I saw...

487
00:31:01,674 --> 00:31:03,789
A lot of sick people.

488
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:08,975
I saw women dressed like nurses,
and I saw a lot of gurneys.

489
00:31:08,976 --> 00:31:11,567
Now, this is one of the original
ads we were able to find.

490
00:31:11,568 --> 00:31:15,316
And basically it says that whatever ails
you, this mineral water would cure it.

491
00:31:15,317 --> 00:31:17,883
Now, I want to show you what
the mineral water looked like.

492
00:31:17,884 --> 00:31:19,326
This is interesting.

493
00:31:19,327 --> 00:31:21,423
They actually bottled
it here in the basement.

494
00:31:21,424 --> 00:31:24,353
You see, it's 1886, Riverside Inn.

495
00:31:24,354 --> 00:31:26,872
- So, they'd just come here and drink it?
- Yeah.

496
00:31:26,873 --> 00:31:29,917
The people that did come
here, they were all sick.

497
00:31:29,918 --> 00:31:34,598
Really? Because I was
sick the entire walk.

498
00:31:34,953 --> 00:31:37,705
Very dizzy, a lot of confusion.

499
00:31:37,706 --> 00:31:40,042
There was severe pain in my head.

500
00:31:40,043 --> 00:31:42,504
I almost vomited at one point.

501
00:31:42,505 --> 00:31:47,125
The living here would
probably experience...

502
00:31:47,515 --> 00:31:49,831
Uh, headaches and nausea.

503
00:31:49,832 --> 00:31:51,692
Hmm.

504
00:31:52,987 --> 00:31:56,463
I might be able to explain that. I
talked to a Professor of Physiology.

505
00:31:56,464 --> 00:31:59,195
He told me magnesium
would never cure anything.

506
00:31:59,196 --> 00:32:02,847
But high contents of
magnesium in your body.

507
00:32:02,848 --> 00:32:04,662
Can make you very sick.

508
00:32:04,663 --> 00:32:08,995
Problems breathing, vomiting,
diarrhea, flushing of the face,

509
00:32:08,996 --> 00:32:11,025
low blood pressure, and dizziness.

510
00:32:11,026 --> 00:32:16,660
And in extreme cases, people have
cardiac arrest and actually die.

511
00:32:16,661 --> 00:32:21,718
We know that at least six people
dropped dead right on the property.

512
00:32:21,719 --> 00:32:24,179
Oh, my gosh.

513
00:32:24,221 --> 00:32:27,257
So, most of the people were
kind of O.D.'ing on this?

514
00:32:27,258 --> 00:32:29,024
Yeah. Basically, yeah.

515
00:32:29,025 --> 00:32:34,925
So, instead of getting better, people
might have killed themselves doing it.

516
00:32:36,901 --> 00:32:38,134
So, what else did you see?

517
00:32:38,135 --> 00:32:41,881
What I noticed was that there were
three different cliques of dead people.

518
00:32:41,882 --> 00:32:45,811
So, there was, like, the group
of elderly people, young adults...

519
00:32:45,812 --> 00:32:50,492
And then what the elderly referred
to as the juvenile delinquents.

520
00:32:50,493 --> 00:32:53,959
The leader of this
elderly group of people

521
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,145
was this guy who had
white hair, a white beard.

522
00:32:58,146 --> 00:32:59,946
He walked with a cane.

523
00:32:59,947 --> 00:33:03,484
And he was just yelling about how...

524
00:33:03,485 --> 00:33:07,092
These two other cliques were obnoxious.

525
00:33:07,093 --> 00:33:10,282
He was very um, authoritative.

526
00:33:10,283 --> 00:33:12,235
You get a good look at this guy?

527
00:33:12,236 --> 00:33:14,710
I sketched the man I saw.

528
00:33:14,711 --> 00:33:19,091
Well, let's take a look at the sketch.

529
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:33,434
To me, this actually looks like
a younger version of Dr. Gray.

530
00:33:33,435 --> 00:33:36,555
You guys take a look.

531
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:42,499
See, the nose, to me,
is what's so accurate.

532
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,380
And even the eyes.

533
00:33:46,184 --> 00:33:48,874
- Yeah, the nostrils.
- Mm hmm.

534
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:50,795
Yeah.

535
00:33:52,094 --> 00:33:55,679
The expression looks the same.

536
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,348
So, do you think that the
guy with the cane is Dr. Gray?

537
00:33:58,349 --> 00:34:01,169
I think so, yeah.

538
00:34:02,137 --> 00:34:05,918
Now, do these cliques do anything that
can affect the people that are living?

539
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,226
There were specifically three
ways of experiencing them.

540
00:34:10,227 --> 00:34:15,829
The young adults, they're into movement,
moving objects, things like that.

541
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:19,414
And they're fascinated by the
electricity and what it can do

542
00:34:19,415 --> 00:34:22,641
and what they can do with it
and all that kind of stuff.

543
00:34:22,642 --> 00:34:27,286
And then the little juvenile
delinquents are really bad.

544
00:34:27,287 --> 00:34:30,686
They spy on people.
That's their big thing.

545
00:34:30,687 --> 00:34:34,214
The living will often feel watched...

546
00:34:34,215 --> 00:34:36,675
Um, by them.

547
00:34:37,555 --> 00:34:39,871
Literally, any time I'm
walking the hallways upstairs.

548
00:34:39,872 --> 00:34:44,672
I know I'm being
watched. You just feel it.

549
00:34:45,496 --> 00:34:47,648
For at least 10 years...

550
00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:50,346
There have been lights
that come on by themselves,

551
00:34:50,347 --> 00:34:53,133
and when we're closed for the
winter, the building is locked.

552
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:58,193
Somebody will call and say, oh, there was
a light on on the third floor last night.

553
00:34:58,194 --> 00:35:00,835
And I know nobody's been there.

554
00:35:00,836 --> 00:35:03,479
The other thing she brought up was
another thing we talked about...

555
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,148
Stuff moving, disappearing.

556
00:35:05,149 --> 00:35:09,609
Props, costumes, disappear,
but they always come back.

557
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,723
It's like they're playing
games. They always are.

558
00:35:12,724 --> 00:35:15,363
Could they do a lot more
damage in the future?

559
00:35:15,364 --> 00:35:18,598
Oh well yeah, more and more
devices, will be affected,

560
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:23,759
as they learn how to do
this really, really well.

561
00:35:23,864 --> 00:35:27,971
Just like the living, the dead can become
fixated on developing their abilities.

562
00:35:27,972 --> 00:35:31,219
And the more they practice, the
more they learn to manipulate energy,

563
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,340
and their surroundings.

564
00:35:34,746 --> 00:35:36,980
So, a lot of stuff
so far. Anything else?

565
00:35:36,981 --> 00:35:38,115
Mm-hmm.

566
00:35:38,116 --> 00:35:42,719
The next thing I saw was a bad
scene when I was on the second floor.

567
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,620
I saw a man who killed a woman.

568
00:35:47,275 --> 00:35:50,595
They were intimate with each
other. He was much older than her.

569
00:35:50,596 --> 00:35:51,899
They were fighting.

570
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:56,808
I saw him kneeling on her chest
and strangled her in a weird way.

571
00:35:56,809 --> 00:36:01,371
I did come across one murder, but I'm not
sure if it's the one you're talking about.

572
00:36:01,372 --> 00:36:04,374
A woman by the name of Doris
Hatch. She was a 22-year-old girl.

573
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:07,447
She lived a two-minute
walk from the hotel here.

574
00:36:07,448 --> 00:36:10,201
This is Doris Hatch.

575
00:36:10,202 --> 00:36:12,395
Back in '53, she goes missing.

576
00:36:12,396 --> 00:36:15,734
The person they think responsible for
her death was this guy, William Turner...

577
00:36:15,735 --> 00:36:18,195
This is him.

578
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:21,124
You had said that she was
younger and he was older?

579
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:25,361
Well, she was 22, he was 33, and
they were intimately involved.

580
00:36:25,362 --> 00:36:27,499
- Was he married?
- He was.

581
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,404
Uh-huh. Yeah.

582
00:36:29,405 --> 00:36:31,336
She doesn't get found for two 1/2 years.

583
00:36:31,337 --> 00:36:34,742
And when she does get found, her body's
so decomposed that the best they can do

584
00:36:34,743 --> 00:36:38,007
is figure out that she was
hacked to death with a machete.

585
00:36:38,008 --> 00:36:38,909
Oh.

586
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:42,078
I think that they were in the
building and they did fight here,

587
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,815
but I didn't see him
hack her up for anything.

588
00:36:44,816 --> 00:36:49,496
- But you got that she was murdered?
- Yes.

589
00:36:52,523 --> 00:36:54,489
What else did you see?

590
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:58,167
I saw people on the
ground, and they were dead.

591
00:36:58,168 --> 00:37:02,065
And their bodies were bloated,
so I got that they drowned.

592
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:04,968
Well, that's easy enough to explain.
This is French Creek out here.

593
00:37:04,969 --> 00:37:07,737
It actually runs over a hundred
miles. It's actually a river.

594
00:37:07,738 --> 00:37:10,387
And there's been a lot of
drownings associated with it.

595
00:37:10,388 --> 00:37:13,373
Two of those drownings actually
took place right on the property.

596
00:37:13,374 --> 00:37:17,852
Back in '79, this kid here,
Robert Alan Griffith, 17 years old.

597
00:37:17,853 --> 00:37:19,749
Went in the water and he drowned.

598
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:24,787
A year later, a kid named Michael
Catalano, right here again, drowned.

599
00:37:24,788 --> 00:37:28,483
He was 24 years old at the time.

600
00:37:28,484 --> 00:37:33,596
When I was trying to leave,
I kept going to the water.

601
00:37:33,597 --> 00:37:36,466
I saw this woman. She
jumped inside of me.

602
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:40,570
She was trying to make me
go in the water and drown.

603
00:37:40,571 --> 00:37:41,290
Oh.

604
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:45,876
She was feeling very desperate,
and she was in mourning.

605
00:37:45,877 --> 00:37:50,303
She's the only entity that
I came into contact with...

606
00:37:50,304 --> 00:37:52,648
That I felt an immediate threat from.

607
00:37:52,649 --> 00:37:55,388
Now, when you say she jumped you,
she went into your body physically?

608
00:37:55,389 --> 00:37:56,201
Yes.

609
00:37:56,202 --> 00:37:59,007
You don't think that she's responsible
for the death of these two kids?

610
00:37:59,008 --> 00:38:00,656
It's a possibility.

611
00:38:00,657 --> 00:38:04,895
What about the guests that go near
the water, could they be at risk?

612
00:38:04,896 --> 00:38:06,756
Yes.

613
00:38:07,464 --> 00:38:11,724
She's capable of jumping other people.

614
00:38:24,658 --> 00:38:27,672
Now, when you say she jumped you,
she went into your body physically?

615
00:38:27,673 --> 00:38:28,477
Yes.

616
00:38:28,478 --> 00:38:31,280
You don't think that she's responsible
for the death of these two kids?

617
00:38:31,281 --> 00:38:32,929
It's a possibility.

618
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:38,830
What about the guests that go near
the water, could they be at risk?

619
00:38:39,467 --> 00:38:41,327
Yes.

620
00:38:41,604 --> 00:38:45,864
She's capable of jumping other people.

621
00:38:50,259 --> 00:38:53,296
You got that look that you guys are a
little worried about your guests now.

622
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:57,782
That makes me concerned. The
water has always been a concern.

623
00:38:57,783 --> 00:39:01,085
Guests are here all
the time for weddings.

624
00:39:01,086 --> 00:39:04,154
You know, a wedding
reception that's outside,

625
00:39:04,155 --> 00:39:08,293
kids running around, we certainly
don't need anyone helping them go over.

626
00:39:08,294 --> 00:39:11,174
Mnh-mnh-mnh-mnh.

627
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:12,930
Larry and Brenda, listen.

628
00:39:12,931 --> 00:39:17,046
You got hit with a lot of
information today, a lot of history.

629
00:39:17,047 --> 00:39:19,393
The big question is,
is it safe for you guys,

630
00:39:19,394 --> 00:39:21,837
your employees, and
your guests to be here?

631
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:26,938
For that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

632
00:39:27,178 --> 00:39:30,080
Obviously, I don't care
for the woman outside.

633
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:33,758
I think that she is possibly...

634
00:39:33,759 --> 00:39:36,517
A threat to the living.

635
00:39:36,518 --> 00:39:42,098
So, what I would recommend
is to find a psychotherapist.

636
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:47,260
You can go to the local university,
go to their Psych Department.

637
00:39:47,261 --> 00:39:51,364
But this psychotherapist
also needs to be a medium.

638
00:39:51,365 --> 00:39:56,487
This individual should come
and work with the woman outside.

639
00:39:56,488 --> 00:39:59,026
Just to talk to her, find out what's up,

640
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:03,812
what's going on, why is
she here, all of that.

641
00:40:03,813 --> 00:40:07,415
The second thing is to do a
cleansing of this building.

642
00:40:07,416 --> 00:40:12,290
And what this will do is help with
the removal of some of the residual...

643
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:16,049
Uh, that's here, and also
some of the dead that are here.

644
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:18,123
Then what I would recommend,

645
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:22,434
is you teach the housekeepers
how to do this basic cleansing.

646
00:40:22,435 --> 00:40:28,335
And that one time per week they
incorporate it into their regular duties.

647
00:40:28,471 --> 00:40:32,791
As far as the cliques that I
encountered, the three main cliques...

648
00:40:32,792 --> 00:40:35,702
I don't feel personally
threatened by them.

649
00:40:35,703 --> 00:40:40,079
They're just more chaotic
within each other's groups.

650
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,625
It's not with any malevolent or...

651
00:40:43,626 --> 00:40:46,623
Malicious intent towards the living.

652
00:40:46,624 --> 00:40:50,285
It's up to you if you want to tell
the sensitive to remove them or not.

653
00:40:50,286 --> 00:40:54,641
Um, some may just leave anyway
if they're tired of being here.

654
00:40:54,642 --> 00:40:56,591
Let me ask you. What about the medium?

655
00:40:56,592 --> 00:40:59,466
Will she move on our Dr. Gray?

656
00:40:59,467 --> 00:41:02,472
I wouldn't try to move him on.

657
00:41:02,473 --> 00:41:06,706
Um, but if he chooses
to go, then he can leave.

658
00:41:06,707 --> 00:41:10,247
- He's not a threat?
- No.

659
00:41:10,311 --> 00:41:14,577
The ultimate question is once they do
all this, do you think they'll be okay?

660
00:41:14,578 --> 00:41:16,233
I think so, yes.

661
00:41:16,234 --> 00:41:19,395
Now, you guys got to be relieved. I mean,
this was your dream to own this place.

662
00:41:19,396 --> 00:41:21,915
- Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

663
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:26,933
I'm really glad that we can
actually aid people in moving on.

664
00:41:26,934 --> 00:41:30,354
If they need to move on
and keep our guests safe.

665
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:34,366
That, above all, is
very important to us.

666
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:38,567
Just knowing that there's a solution.

667
00:41:38,862 --> 00:41:42,282
And that everyone is safe.

668
00:41:42,382 --> 00:41:45,317
Our guests are safe, we're safe.

669
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:48,455
Our employees are safe.

670
00:41:48,456 --> 00:41:51,396
It's a big relief.

671
00:41:51,779 --> 00:41:54,492
With so much death
surrounding this location.

672
00:41:54,493 --> 00:41:57,975
Brenda and Larry had their
work cut out for them.

673
00:41:57,976 --> 00:42:02,161
I really hope they follow my advice
and get rid of the woman by the creek.

674
00:42:02,162 --> 00:42:06,877
Or their next event might
not have a happy ending.
