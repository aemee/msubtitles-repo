1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:15,089
There's a lot of past violence.

3
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,735
Somebody's terrified.

4
00:00:16,736 --> 00:00:18,062
I'm afraid of being hurt.

5
00:00:18,063 --> 00:00:20,331
I've been touched.

6
00:00:20,332 --> 00:00:22,481
She definitely makes physical contact.

7
00:00:22,482 --> 00:00:24,584
Three scratches starting to draw blood.

8
00:00:24,585 --> 00:00:27,050
- Something went through me.
- She throws a fit.

9
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:29,322
You need to get out of here right now.

10
00:00:29,323 --> 00:00:32,359
They're just in hell.

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,095
Living people have messed
with the dead here a lot.

12
00:00:35,096 --> 00:00:38,036
That was a mistake.

13
00:00:39,267 --> 00:00:41,459
They're being watched.

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,419
My name is Amy Allan.

15
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,439
This thing likes death.

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,174
I see dead people.

17
00:00:48,175 --> 00:00:49,809
This thing's, like, a monster.

18
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,844
I speak to dead people...

19
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:53,280
And he's pissed off now.

20
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:54,915
And they speak to me...

21
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:56,316
His head was cracked.

22
00:00:56,317 --> 00:00:59,619
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

23
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,187
This guy was murdered.

24
00:01:01,188 --> 00:01:02,822
I rely on my partner.

25
00:01:02,823 --> 00:01:06,492
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective...

26
00:01:06,493 --> 00:01:09,095
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

27
00:01:09,096 --> 00:01:12,399
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,800
You saw her?

29
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:15,101
It's my job to reveal them.

30
00:01:15,102 --> 00:01:16,448
Why would you stay here?

31
00:01:16,449 --> 00:01:18,604
But Steve and I never speak...

32
00:01:18,605 --> 00:01:20,540
We never communicate
during an investigation.

33
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:21,874
Until the very end.

34
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:23,743
Stop it.

35
00:01:23,744 --> 00:01:25,719
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

36
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,281
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

37
00:01:28,282 --> 00:01:29,582
Or time to get out.

38
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:34,323
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

39
00:01:50,804 --> 00:01:56,704
Our clients turn to Amy and me
when they've run out of options.

40
00:01:57,783 --> 00:01:59,359
I dig into the property's history,

41
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,604
looking for witnesses and
hidden details of the past...

42
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:10,505
While Amy conducts her own
investigation speaking to the dead.

43
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:13,526
I'm in Death Valley
Junction, California.

44
00:02:13,527 --> 00:02:17,663
It's about 90 minutes
outside of Las Vegas.

45
00:02:17,664 --> 00:02:21,984
Less than 20 people live in this town.

46
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,837
One of them, a guy
named Rich, called us in.

47
00:02:24,838 --> 00:02:28,267
He runs a historic hotel that's
connected to an opera house...

48
00:02:28,268 --> 00:02:33,300
And says the activity there is so
bad, he's losing employees and guests.

49
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:39,201
He's afraid of losing his business, and I'm
hoping Amy and I can do something for him.

50
00:02:49,897 --> 00:02:51,210
Before Amy arrives,

51
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:57,111
I clear the area of anything
that could influence her findings.

52
00:02:57,339 --> 00:02:59,990
This hotel has a large collection
of historical photographs,

53
00:02:59,991 --> 00:03:04,499
and antique memorabilia that
have to be covered or removed.

54
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:10,400
When I'm finished, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

55
00:03:28,252 --> 00:03:31,900
So, I don't even know where to start
because I'm kind of overwhelmed.

56
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:36,701
But I do feel like
there was unusual deaths.

57
00:03:38,902 --> 00:03:42,682
There are people in the ground.

58
00:03:42,996 --> 00:03:45,694
I get, like, many people dying.

59
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:49,248
They can't breathe. They can't
breathe. They just suffocate to death.

60
00:03:49,249 --> 00:03:55,149
And somebody said, "we walk upon the
bodies of the dead and their souls, too".

61
00:04:10,096 --> 00:04:12,558
Now, Rich, when we spoke
on the phone, you sounded

62
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:15,006
pretty concerned about the
business here and maybe losing it.

63
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:17,318
- What's going on?
- We've got...

64
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:20,086
Voices, full-blown apparitions...

65
00:04:20,087 --> 00:04:24,424
It's even gotten physical at this point.
We've got scratches, people being touched.

66
00:04:24,425 --> 00:04:26,851
I'm losing employees.
I'm losing business.

67
00:04:26,852 --> 00:04:28,577
They're leaving in the
middle of the night,

68
00:04:28,578 --> 00:04:30,816
or they're deciding
not to stay here at all.

69
00:04:30,817 --> 00:04:33,026
- Do you live on the property at all?
- Yeah, I do.

70
00:04:33,027 --> 00:04:34,167
- You do?
- Yes.

71
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:35,359
Okay, do you live alone?

72
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,459
No, actually, my girlfriend, Mary Lee,
who works with me here, as well, is here.

73
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,510
- Why don't you just leave?
- Leaving is not an option.

74
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:46,414
I've got my life invested in here.

75
00:04:46,415 --> 00:04:50,517
I made a promise to the founder
of this particular place...

76
00:04:50,518 --> 00:04:51,869
Okay.

77
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,297
And I gave her my word that
I would stay here and...

78
00:04:56,298 --> 00:04:59,253
- Carry on her vision and legacy.
- Who owns it?

79
00:04:59,254 --> 00:05:01,461
- Her name's Marta Becket.
- Okay.

80
00:05:01,462 --> 00:05:03,530
- She's 88 years old...
- Okay.

81
00:05:03,531 --> 00:05:06,357
And she's got a famous opera house here.

82
00:05:06,358 --> 00:05:10,867
As well as many other
structures on this property here.

83
00:05:10,868 --> 00:05:14,407
And she owns all 268
acres of the facility.

84
00:05:14,408 --> 00:05:16,328
Okay.

85
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,651
I'm just getting, like...

86
00:05:24,652 --> 00:05:28,688
A lot of people being
treated like [Bleep]

87
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:32,469
A lot of people being murdered.

88
00:05:34,295 --> 00:05:38,855
So much has happened
here over the years.

89
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:44,473
This is not good.
This... this is not good.

90
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,753
As far as guests go, what have they
complained about in the bedrooms?

91
00:06:00,754 --> 00:06:03,053
They complain of voices.

92
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:07,260
They also have a shadow figure that they
see at the foot of their bed, as well.

93
00:06:07,261 --> 00:06:10,596
Now, you mentioned
scratches on some guests.

94
00:06:10,597 --> 00:06:13,274
An older man came to me,
and he was right-handed...

95
00:06:13,275 --> 00:06:17,121
And actually had two
scratch marks across there.

96
00:06:17,122 --> 00:06:19,259
- Have you seen them?
- Mm-hmm.

97
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,441
What about his nails?
Were they sharp, long?

98
00:06:21,442 --> 00:06:23,743
They were short and well-manicured.

99
00:06:23,744 --> 00:06:25,044
What else has happened?

100
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:29,276
Guests are coming back to their rooms after
the day, and the maids have made their bed

101
00:06:29,277 --> 00:06:33,416
and it's like somebody has
actually sat down on the bed,

102
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:36,314
and there's even hand
prints on some of them.

103
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:39,421
Are you sure it's not one of the employees
coming in and maybe just relaxing,

104
00:06:39,422 --> 00:06:41,761
or maybe trying to get
another employee in trouble?

105
00:06:41,762 --> 00:06:44,631
You know, I've asked
them, and I don't think so.

106
00:06:44,632 --> 00:06:47,053
Do guests get pissed
off because they think

107
00:06:47,054 --> 00:06:49,415
somebody's been in their room
when they weren't supposed to?

108
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,696
Absolutely.

109
00:07:04,837 --> 00:07:07,387
There's a woman who
goes in all these beds.

110
00:07:07,388 --> 00:07:10,236
She goes in all the beds.

111
00:07:10,237 --> 00:07:12,958
She's been here for a
long time... long time.

112
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,874
I see her getting kicked.
She's getting destroyed.

113
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:21,961
I just see men beating her
face in, and she's naked.

114
00:07:21,962 --> 00:07:23,603
You have any idea why?

115
00:07:23,604 --> 00:07:27,564
She's dirty. She was doing drugs.

116
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,053
There's, like, nothing you
can do to cover this up.

117
00:07:31,054 --> 00:07:35,794
It's a mess outside.
It's a mess in here.

118
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,834
Now, this is the older
part of the hotel?

119
00:07:44,835 --> 00:07:48,391
It is, Steve. This is a side that's
not open to the public, generally.

120
00:07:48,392 --> 00:07:50,600
It hasn't been used
since the '30s or '40s.

121
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:53,165
And we affectionately
call it Spooky Hollow.

122
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,908
It's always been called that, so
we just carry on the tradition.

123
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,854
So, are you experiencing stuff
in this part of the building?

124
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:01,339
This side of the hotel
is totally different.

125
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,353
It's got a different feeling.

126
00:08:03,354 --> 00:08:08,080
There's an overwhelming male energy
that tends to not like people in here.

127
00:08:08,081 --> 00:08:10,157
Does this thing frighten you?

128
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:15,498
I do try to avoid it. It's
not comfortable for me.

129
00:08:22,195 --> 00:08:25,034
So, there's a man here, and he...

130
00:08:25,035 --> 00:08:29,415
He's very much in charge of everything.

131
00:08:31,739 --> 00:08:34,407
I think he really hates living people.

132
00:08:34,408 --> 00:08:37,395
Well, I know that that's his space.

133
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:41,101
I don't think he likes
people back there.

134
00:08:41,102 --> 00:08:45,168
Feeling like somebody's
standing right there...

135
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:47,550
And just feeling, like, terrified...

136
00:08:47,551 --> 00:08:50,491
Absolutely terrified.

137
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,926
Is he actually dangerous?

138
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:56,529
When he feels like the
living are [Bleep] with him.

139
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:00,266
He can become whatever scares them.

140
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:03,927
He can take your breath away.

141
00:09:05,572 --> 00:09:10,612
He can make you feel
that fear in your stomach.

142
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:16,749
What else is going on?

143
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,105
A lot of paranormal people
like to come back here.

144
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:20,553
What do you mean, paranormal people?

145
00:09:20,554 --> 00:09:23,075
Well, people that are doing
investigations on their own,

146
00:09:23,076 --> 00:09:26,082
or they want to have an experience.
They like to come back here.

147
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,269
Rich, do you think that
you might be making it worse

148
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,077
by letting these
investigators come in here?

149
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:32,793
I think maybe that it's a possibility.

150
00:09:32,794 --> 00:09:36,574
I actually had a friend who came
here who's kind of an investigator.

151
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:39,667
She asked for a sign, you know,
show me that you're back here.

152
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:43,556
And they ended up being scratched,
and, so, she went ahead and showed me,

153
00:09:43,557 --> 00:09:46,880
and what I saw were three scratches...

154
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:48,396
- Okay.
- Right across the back.

155
00:09:48,397 --> 00:09:50,979
And actually starting to draw blood.

156
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,700
- On her back?
- On her back.

157
00:10:02,095 --> 00:10:05,834
He's been tortured by the living.

158
00:10:05,835 --> 00:10:08,655
He wallows, and...

159
00:10:08,957 --> 00:10:13,817
He has no intentions of
going anywhere else...

160
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,800
And I think that this
place has been investigated.

161
00:10:20,898 --> 00:10:24,881
The living people have messed
with the dead here a lot...

162
00:10:24,882 --> 00:10:28,122
In really negative ways.

163
00:10:29,788 --> 00:10:32,728
That was a mistake.

164
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:03,607
What is it exactly that you do here?

165
00:11:03,608 --> 00:11:07,241
Well, I'm an artist, and I
volunteer my time to come up and do

166
00:11:07,242 --> 00:11:10,558
reproductions of the original
signs that were on the hotel.

167
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:13,271
Okay. So, when you come
up, you stay overnight?

168
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:16,293
I do. It's like my second home.

169
00:11:16,294 --> 00:11:19,997
So, tell me what you've
been experiencing, then.

170
00:11:19,998 --> 00:11:22,508
I have experienced a lot
of different things here.

171
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:25,544
From seeing apparitions...

172
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:28,545
I've heard voices...

173
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:30,785
I've even been touched.

174
00:11:30,786 --> 00:11:35,677
So, when I do stay
here, I don't sleep well.

175
00:11:35,678 --> 00:11:40,126
All right. Now, what's the most
terrifying experience you've had up here?

176
00:11:40,127 --> 00:11:41,723
First time I was here,

177
00:11:41,724 --> 00:11:46,092
there's a corner right next to
where I was working on a sign.

178
00:11:46,093 --> 00:11:51,973
I suddenly felt this energy
come into the corner that was...

179
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:55,315
Really menacing...

180
00:11:55,694 --> 00:11:59,449
Like a mob mentality, and
I could hear them say...

181
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:04,430
"Lady, you need to get
out of here right now".

182
00:12:05,783 --> 00:12:09,589
It's a really strong feeling of anger.

183
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:13,588
It can get so strong that it... It
makes me feel sick to my stomach.

184
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:15,238
Like where you get
nauseous or something?

185
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:21,139
Get nauseous, I feel dizzy, and sometimes
almost as though I'm gonna pass out.

186
00:12:29,109 --> 00:12:32,111
In this area, there was a group of men.

187
00:12:32,112 --> 00:12:35,408
There's a lot of fighting.

188
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:38,224
This is a long time
ago. This is maybe...

189
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:40,250
1870s...

190
00:12:40,251 --> 00:12:42,231
1880s.

191
00:12:46,653 --> 00:12:50,133
People are asking for help.

192
00:12:50,748 --> 00:12:54,443
A lot of pain... physical pain.

193
00:12:54,444 --> 00:12:57,637
It's just too much. It's just too much.

194
00:12:57,638 --> 00:13:01,859
The hallways of this hotel are crawling
with dead people from a long time ago.

195
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,965
They're in a great deal of pain,
and I'm experiencing their suffering.

196
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:10,085
I feel like I'm sick.

197
00:13:10,086 --> 00:13:13,926
I can't walk. I can't... move.

198
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:18,000
There's too many things
that have happened here.

199
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:21,830
Like, some people are really sick, and
then there are some people who are...

200
00:13:21,831 --> 00:13:24,651
Hurting themselves.

201
00:13:26,585 --> 00:13:30,621
And there are some people
who kill each other.

202
00:13:30,622 --> 00:13:34,702
Like, it's just a [Bleep] disaster.

203
00:13:46,938 --> 00:13:50,295
So, Mary Lee, I understand
that you and Rich live together.

204
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:53,011
- Right. Mm-hmm.
- And you and him run the place.

205
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:55,376
- Exactly. Yeah.
- Okay.

206
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:59,087
Now, Rich is concerned
about the business...

207
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,727
Losing business because
of what's going on here.

208
00:14:02,728 --> 00:14:04,973
Well, we've had people leave.

209
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:06,070
Just like that?

210
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:08,560
- I won't stay here.
- You won't?

211
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:10,203
- You live on the premise right?
- Mm-hmm.

212
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:12,881
On the property? But you
wouldn't stay in the hotel.

213
00:14:12,882 --> 00:14:14,065
Mm-mm.

214
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:16,056
So, can I assume you've
had experiences here?

215
00:14:16,057 --> 00:14:19,637
- Yes. I've had several.
- Okay.

216
00:14:19,638 --> 00:14:23,358
I've seen shadows, apparitions.

217
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,786
- I've been channeled.
- Channeled? What does that mean?

218
00:14:27,787 --> 00:14:31,412
Where something went through me.

219
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:37,313
I've been afraid to, like, be
in different places by myself.

220
00:14:39,618 --> 00:14:43,638
Things, recently, have gotten worse.

221
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:47,562
It's just really hard.

222
00:14:51,687 --> 00:14:55,412
I think that people see
a lot of dead people here.

223
00:14:55,413 --> 00:14:57,822
So I feel like...

224
00:14:57,823 --> 00:15:03,574
You know, if the people say
they see something back here...

225
00:15:03,575 --> 00:15:09,215
I think that they would feel
kind of out-of-body-ish...

226
00:15:09,305 --> 00:15:11,189
And...

227
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,861
Very uncomfortable...

228
00:15:13,862 --> 00:15:16,742
And not themselves.

229
00:15:23,913 --> 00:15:28,317
Mary Lee, let me ask you a question. Have
you expressed to Rich how upset you are?

230
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:34,218
He knows I'm afraid, but I don't
think he realizes how afraid.

231
00:15:34,514 --> 00:15:36,167
And why is that?

232
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:42,068
Because we're here so much, I
don't want to feel like, um...

233
00:15:42,378 --> 00:15:45,072
Like I'm a chicken.

234
00:15:45,073 --> 00:15:48,946
I don't think that he realizes...

235
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:53,027
That um, I'm afraid of being hurt.

236
00:15:55,383 --> 00:15:59,523
- Okay.
- I'm really, really scared.

237
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,194
I spoke with some locals who told me,

238
00:16:15,195 --> 00:16:17,541
Death Valley has a
rich mining history...

239
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:21,693
And that one used to operate
right next to the hotel.

240
00:16:21,694 --> 00:16:24,548
I'm heading over to meet with a
local historian, who also happens to

241
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:30,449
be a Park Ranger to see if he's
got any information to help my case.

242
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:42,088
Bob, I understand that the hotel I'm
investigating used to be a mining area.

243
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:44,104
- Is that correct?
- That's correct.

244
00:16:44,105 --> 00:16:45,950
Okay, what kind of mining
are we talking about?

245
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:49,288
They were mining for a
very rich form of borax.

246
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:52,196
It's an industrial product
that's used in welding.

247
00:16:52,197 --> 00:16:54,910
- What was it like for these guys here?
- Brutal.

248
00:16:54,911 --> 00:16:58,413
These men were working in tunnels
on average about 4 feet high.

249
00:16:58,414 --> 00:16:59,409
Wow.

250
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:03,575
Just wide enough for two men with
picks and shovels and dynamite.

251
00:17:03,576 --> 00:17:06,159
There were no specialists. You
had to know how to plant dynamite.

252
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,331
So I assume there had to be some accidents
and deaths associated with the mine.

253
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:12,661
There had to be accidents and that kind
of a thing, there had to be collapses.

254
00:17:12,662 --> 00:17:17,702
Oh, it was a pretty short
and pretty hard life.

255
00:17:19,776 --> 00:17:24,336
And there's these
people who are trapped.

256
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:30,107
There's a lot of men, and
the men are... are wrecks.

257
00:17:31,058 --> 00:17:34,556
I keep encountering this large
group of men all over the property.

258
00:17:34,557 --> 00:17:38,270
Each time I see them, I
begin experiencing their pain,

259
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:41,458
both physically and emotionally.

260
00:17:41,459 --> 00:17:45,181
You can move better if you crawl.

261
00:17:45,182 --> 00:17:48,692
Because otherwise, it's too difficult.

262
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:54,593
Because your legs are useless,
especially at the end of the day.

263
00:17:58,915 --> 00:18:02,515
Everybody's [Bleep] miserable.

264
00:18:02,952 --> 00:18:06,072
They're just in hell.

265
00:18:06,706 --> 00:18:12,494
Do you have any idea what was on that
property before the hotel was there?

266
00:18:12,495 --> 00:18:14,730
A lady by the name of Shotgun Kitty...

267
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:18,117
- Okay...
- Ran a brothel and a bar.

268
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:21,131
That's her and her husband and two kids.

269
00:18:21,132 --> 00:18:22,928
Now, where'd the name Shotgun come from?

270
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:26,307
She got the name Shotgun Kitty because,
evidently, she didn't go anywhere

271
00:18:26,308 --> 00:18:31,876
without her shotgun, and she was
known to be an extremely good shot.

272
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,902
She ran the town, basically.

273
00:18:33,903 --> 00:18:37,874
I mean, these miners made a minimal
amount of money, you know, pennies a day.

274
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:42,324
And what little they did have, they
would spend at Kitty's businesses.

275
00:18:42,325 --> 00:18:46,462
They'd spend it in the brothel,
or they'd spend it in the bar.

276
00:18:46,463 --> 00:18:48,552
She ruled the roost.

277
00:18:48,553 --> 00:18:51,759
When Shotgun Kitty said something,
that was it, you didn't argue with her.

278
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,980
I don't care how drunk
you were or anything else.

279
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,047
There's this older woman.

280
00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:08,501
She's, like, probably in her 50s.

281
00:19:08,502 --> 00:19:12,949
She's rather short.
She's kind of chubby.

282
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,657
I feel like she was a caretaker.

283
00:19:15,658 --> 00:19:20,878
If she was an owner, she
was very, very hands-on.

284
00:19:22,832 --> 00:19:26,833
She just feels like, yeah, that's
mine, and I need to still be in charge.

285
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:29,396
Like, she was very business...
all about the business.

286
00:19:29,397 --> 00:19:31,362
She's unhappy about
how this place is run,

287
00:19:31,363 --> 00:19:35,738
and it's almost like her dream is
just falling apart before her eyes.

288
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:40,392
So, she's pissed off that [Bleep]
not being the way she wants it to be.

289
00:19:40,393 --> 00:19:43,118
But she's not trying to help.
She's just making it worse.

290
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,786
What is she doing
that's making it worse?

291
00:19:44,787 --> 00:19:46,495
When she sees something not being done

292
00:19:46,496 --> 00:19:48,924
the way that she wanted
it done, she throws a fit.

293
00:19:48,925 --> 00:19:53,065
She definitely makes physical contact.

294
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:02,322
I'm at the library to see what I can

295
00:20:02,323 --> 00:20:05,040
find out about the
property I'm investigating.

296
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,978
Digging through the archives, I
uncovered an article about a hotel

297
00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:13,448
employee named Thomas Blower
who took his own life in 1947.

298
00:20:13,449 --> 00:20:16,386
The location where he hung himself...

299
00:20:16,387 --> 00:20:19,267
The Amargosa Hotel.

300
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:25,164
Now that I know someone who lived and
worked at the Amargosa hung himself,

301
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:28,436
I need to find out more
details about this case.

302
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:32,661
I've contacted a local who calls
himself a historic explorer.

303
00:20:32,662 --> 00:20:38,182
And says he's got lots of
information to help me out.

304
00:20:42,712 --> 00:20:46,667
Tim, why'd you bring me to
this part of the building?

305
00:20:46,668 --> 00:20:49,457
The gentleman, Thomas Blower,
that you're investigating,

306
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,708
actually hung himself in this area.

307
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,270
- Right here?
- Correct.

308
00:20:53,271 --> 00:20:55,191
Okay.

309
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:59,207
So, what were the circumstances
behind the hanging?

310
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:03,629
In 1947, he was a
65-year-old janitor.

311
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:07,076
During lunchtime, when everybody
else in the staff was having lunch.

312
00:21:07,077 --> 00:21:11,152
He came down here, tied
a rope, and hung himself.

313
00:21:11,153 --> 00:21:15,184
What would make a 65-year-old...
which is kind of old for a suicide...

314
00:21:15,185 --> 00:21:16,311
Do that?

315
00:21:16,312 --> 00:21:19,449
He might not have been very happy
with the outcome of his life.

316
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,559
In what way?

317
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,030
He is actually kind of
an interesting character.

318
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:26,691
Even though he was listed as a
janitor, he did a lot of traveling.

319
00:21:26,692 --> 00:21:32,331
He actually traveled a lot between Canada,
The United States, England, and Australia.

320
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:36,858
This is a 1930s travel voucher
for a Mr. Thomas Blower.

321
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:40,948
It shows that he actually crossed
from The United States into Canada,

322
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:44,009
with $2,500 in 1930.

323
00:21:44,712 --> 00:21:46,781
- $2,500?
- Yes.

324
00:21:46,782 --> 00:21:49,065
So, where the hell's he coming
up with this kind of money?

325
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:53,655
One of the speculations is that he might've
actually been a road agent at the time.

326
00:21:53,656 --> 00:21:56,089
Road agent you're talking about
somebody that does robberies?

327
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,206
Yes.

328
00:21:57,207 --> 00:22:00,134
A road agent is an
individual who would...

329
00:22:00,135 --> 00:22:04,706
Stop a traveler and take anything
of value and then disappear.

330
00:22:04,707 --> 00:22:08,813
Okay. So, now he's 65 years old,
he had money at some point...

331
00:22:08,814 --> 00:22:09,809
Yes.

332
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,568
And out of nowhere, he goes
from being a highway robber,

333
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:15,319
to being a janitor and
then hanging himself.

334
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:20,238
Yes, and to anybody who actually
was making the money that,

335
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:24,584
it's obvious that he was
making or obtaining...

336
00:22:24,585 --> 00:22:28,965
That's a major blow to somebody's ego.

337
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,444
Do you want to go in there?

338
00:22:35,445 --> 00:22:39,645
Not really. That's kind of his area.

339
00:22:40,476 --> 00:22:45,154
This angry man wants me to know that
he controls this section of the hotel.

340
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:50,011
He hates living people, and he
has disturbing ways of showing it.

341
00:22:50,012 --> 00:22:53,867
When I first saw him, he scared me.

342
00:22:53,868 --> 00:22:59,628
He still kind of scares me.
Like, I know what he can do.

343
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:07,090
He...

344
00:23:08,273 --> 00:23:11,888
He did a lot of bad things in his life.

345
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:13,414
What sort of bad things?

346
00:23:13,415 --> 00:23:17,752
He wanted to be respected.
He wanted to be...

347
00:23:17,753 --> 00:23:20,393
Feared... and...

348
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:26,342
You know, he was... he was.

349
00:23:26,965 --> 00:23:30,181
He didn't care if disrespected.
He didn't care if he took.

350
00:23:30,182 --> 00:23:32,981
He did whatever he needed
to do to gain as much power

351
00:23:32,982 --> 00:23:35,845
and respect from his
people as he possibly could.

352
00:23:35,846 --> 00:23:39,746
He doesn't know how to be good.

353
00:23:40,577 --> 00:23:44,117
I feel pain around my neck.

354
00:23:44,315 --> 00:23:46,736
I feel like...

355
00:23:46,737 --> 00:23:49,437
He's strangling.

356
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,708
Now that I know about
the hotel's troubled past,

357
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:14,976
I'm going to meet up
with its current owner.

358
00:24:14,977 --> 00:24:17,427
- Hi. Marta?
- Hi.

359
00:24:17,428 --> 00:24:23,328
I need to see if she's experienced
anything strange during her time here.

360
00:24:27,438 --> 00:24:32,542
So, Marta, I was talking to Rich, and he
told me that you've been here a long time.

361
00:24:32,543 --> 00:24:35,282
Oh, yeah. 43 years.

362
00:24:35,283 --> 00:24:37,064
Okay, what brought you out here?

363
00:24:37,065 --> 00:24:40,500
We were kind of looking for a
place to settle out in the west,

364
00:24:40,501 --> 00:24:42,770
and I fell in love with the place.

365
00:24:42,771 --> 00:24:44,562
So, you're not afraid of this place?

366
00:24:44,563 --> 00:24:47,426
No, no. I love it.

367
00:24:47,427 --> 00:24:49,624
So, Marta, let me ask
you a question about Rich.

368
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:54,171
He's telling me about some pretty
bizarre things that are happening.

369
00:24:54,172 --> 00:24:56,377
Have you ever experienced anything?

370
00:24:56,378 --> 00:24:59,325
Well, there was a sound
at the foot of the stage,

371
00:24:59,326 --> 00:25:02,617
every night when I'd
put my costumes away.

372
00:25:02,618 --> 00:25:05,918
It went like this... oh!

373
00:25:07,123 --> 00:25:08,196
So, you heard a voice?

374
00:25:08,197 --> 00:25:13,461
Oh, yes, but it was always when I was
alone in here, hanging up costumes.

375
00:25:13,462 --> 00:25:16,829
Okay. So, has anything
else strange happened here?

376
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:21,072
Well, we had a maintenance man, and
he came running in, and he said...

377
00:25:21,073 --> 00:25:24,683
"Marta! Marta! There's a
dead man in the sewer house!"

378
00:25:24,684 --> 00:25:26,074
Okay.

379
00:25:26,075 --> 00:25:28,459
He said, I just climbed
up the ladder and saw him.

380
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,814
He still has his glasses
on, but he's dead.

381
00:25:32,815 --> 00:25:35,366
His name was Tom Moore.

382
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,232
And he said he was in the sewer house?

383
00:25:37,233 --> 00:25:41,591
The sewer house is a big,
white building across the road.

384
00:25:41,592 --> 00:25:46,144
- Okay, so, it's on the property?
- Oh, yes.

385
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:49,110
Did you ever find out what they
said was his cause of death?

386
00:25:49,111 --> 00:25:53,791
No, it's all been a
mystery. It still is.

387
00:25:56,482 --> 00:26:01,272
I need to check out this sewer house
where Marta said a man was found dead.

388
00:26:01,273 --> 00:26:03,915
Turns out, there's a
local documentary filmmaker

389
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:07,770
who did a lot of research on his death.

390
00:26:07,771 --> 00:26:13,671
He says there's a lot more to
this case than meets the eye.

391
00:26:19,104 --> 00:26:21,506
Well, Ted, thanks for meeting me.

392
00:26:21,507 --> 00:26:25,018
This guy, Moore, were you able to find
out if what Marta told me was true or not?

393
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:27,770
He did die, and the reason
that I brought you here,

394
00:26:27,771 --> 00:26:32,849
is because this is where his body was
found, they say in the rafters, apparently.

395
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,642
Now, when did this happen?

396
00:26:34,643 --> 00:26:37,188
1976, we understand, is
when the death happened.

397
00:26:37,189 --> 00:26:39,757
Were there any police reports
they were able to find out?

398
00:26:39,758 --> 00:26:45,658
Well, actually, there's an
article on the death of Mr. Moore.

399
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:50,401
Okay, so, he was 64 years
old, goes missing in mid-July.

400
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:52,434
This article's in September.

401
00:26:52,435 --> 00:26:54,316
- So, he's missing for two months.
- Correct.

402
00:26:54,317 --> 00:26:56,295
And, I'm telling you,
from July to September,

403
00:26:56,296 --> 00:26:59,034
those are your hottest months
in this neck of the woods.

404
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:03,831
And up in those rafters, the heat... a
body would really decompose really badly.

405
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:05,912
How did they determine
who the hell he was?

406
00:27:05,913 --> 00:27:08,252
They determined from the dental records.

407
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:11,520
All right, did he have any identification
with him, any money, what was the story?

408
00:27:11,521 --> 00:27:14,212
Well, they did find his billfold,

409
00:27:14,213 --> 00:27:17,290
but no money was taken, you
know, anything like that.

410
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:20,705
Why a 64-year-old would go up
into this thing makes no sense.

411
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:24,839
They did an autopsy. They really
couldn't figure out how he died.

412
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,838
- Cause of death is undetermined.
- Undetermined.

413
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:30,107
Could've been a multitude of things.
In New York, it would be an open case.

414
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:33,367
It's still circumstances undetermined,
pending police investigation.

415
00:27:33,368 --> 00:27:37,856
Right, right. And there's been
speculation that it could've been murder...

416
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:40,428
That there could've been
some foul play of some kind.

417
00:27:40,429 --> 00:27:41,324
Okay.

418
00:27:41,325 --> 00:27:45,457
You know, there's only rumblings
that he may have gotten into a fight,

419
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:49,238
and that there was a gun shot.

420
00:27:58,704 --> 00:28:04,604
So, there's a man here, and he
gets a gun right to his head.

421
00:28:08,835 --> 00:28:10,902
It's him and this other man.

422
00:28:10,903 --> 00:28:16,803
He was hiding from this guy, you
know, but the other guy found him...

423
00:28:20,214 --> 00:28:24,449
And the guy just shoots
him right in the head.

424
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:28,152
He gets his [Bleep] head shot in...

425
00:28:28,153 --> 00:28:32,317
And he doesn't die for
awhile. He feels it for awhile.

426
00:28:32,318 --> 00:28:34,124
Do you have any idea when this is?

427
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:37,785
Mm, I'd say, like, 70s, 80s.

428
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:40,013
Okay.

429
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:45,572
The guy who was shot...
he's very confused.

430
00:28:46,328 --> 00:28:51,848
He's walking around a lot.
He's walking around a lot.

431
00:28:53,912 --> 00:28:56,803
I think he's nuts.

432
00:28:56,804 --> 00:29:00,224
I don't like him at all.

433
00:29:00,886 --> 00:29:03,706
He makes me sick.

434
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:33,534
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations...

435
00:29:33,535 --> 00:29:39,435
We're ready to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

436
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:46,535
Amy, I'd like you to
meet Rich and Mary Lee.

437
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:48,538
They're the couple that
actually run the hotel here

438
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:50,061
and actually live on the property.

439
00:29:50,062 --> 00:29:53,272
They're afraid about losing this place
because they're very passionate about it.

440
00:29:53,273 --> 00:29:55,276
They called us in because
in the last three months,

441
00:29:55,277 --> 00:29:57,068
the activity here has gotten really bad.

442
00:29:57,069 --> 00:29:59,095
They have employees that won't stay,

443
00:29:59,096 --> 00:30:01,398
some guests come, and they
wind up leaving in the middle

444
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,370
of the night and just
leave the keys by the desk.

445
00:30:03,371 --> 00:30:04,929
They're scared for their safety.

446
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,572
They want to know if it's safe for
them to keep this place running,

447
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:09,337
and if they can keep it going.

448
00:30:09,338 --> 00:30:15,238
So, that being said, we'll turn it over
to Amy and hear about her walk a little.

449
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:22,787
When I first got here, it was
extremely overwhelming for me...

450
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:26,063
Very painful, physically, and uh...

451
00:30:26,064 --> 00:30:30,788
Definitely, by far, one of the
worst locations that I've done.

452
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:34,560
The first thing that
I encountered was...

453
00:30:34,561 --> 00:30:36,971
A group of sick men.

454
00:30:36,972 --> 00:30:41,547
The feeling that I got from them
was the feeling of being trapped.

455
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:45,509
One person said, you know, if
you crawl, you can move better,

456
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,387
and it feels like hell for them.

457
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:52,562
Well, it makes sense. This was a
mining town back in the early 1900s.

458
00:30:52,563 --> 00:30:55,442
They used to mine for
a mineral called borax.

459
00:30:55,443 --> 00:31:00,500
These mines were very narrow, like 4 feet,
and these guys would have to crawl in...

460
00:31:00,501 --> 00:31:04,732
And actually stick dynamite in and
then crawl back out and blow it up.

461
00:31:04,733 --> 00:31:08,432
The average miner only lasted about 6
months because of the health hazards.

462
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,353
Whoa!

463
00:31:11,126 --> 00:31:15,378
So, the next thing I saw
over in the bedrooms...

464
00:31:15,379 --> 00:31:17,531
I saw this lady.

465
00:31:17,532 --> 00:31:21,103
She was very young...
in her 20s, very thin.

466
00:31:21,104 --> 00:31:25,015
And she seemed to be drugged out.

467
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:28,201
There's a woman who
goes in all these beds.

468
00:31:28,202 --> 00:31:33,662
I just see men beating her
face in, and she's naked.

469
00:31:34,527 --> 00:31:39,266
A lot of times, there's different,
like, hand prints and uh...

470
00:31:39,267 --> 00:31:42,967
Somebody sitting in different
areas in different rooms here.

471
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:45,535
- Like someone had been sitting.
- With both hands on it.

472
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,805
On the bed... or their
hands are on the bed.

473
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:49,240
After it was made up.

474
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:53,124
You mentioned the beating, before the
hotel was built, there were brothels here.

475
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:56,180
And, you know, the miners would frequent
this place, and they were pretty,

476
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:57,958
you know, rough customers.

477
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,299
Interesting.

478
00:32:01,096 --> 00:32:02,579
Um...

479
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,615
The next woman I met, I
met in front of the hotel,

480
00:32:05,616 --> 00:32:09,525
and she was tiny and a little
chubby, and she was in her 50s.

481
00:32:09,526 --> 00:32:11,983
She had spent the
majority of her time here,

482
00:32:11,984 --> 00:32:14,418
and she feels like this place is hers.

483
00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:17,165
And that she still
needs to be in charge.

484
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:21,505
She's very unhappy with
how the place is being run.

485
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:25,735
If she sees something's being done
differently than how she would do it,

486
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:28,094
she kind of throws a fit.

487
00:32:28,095 --> 00:32:32,503
And she does definitely
make physical contact.

488
00:32:32,504 --> 00:32:35,876
Now, one of the reasons
we're here is because your...

489
00:32:35,877 --> 00:32:38,951
- Customers are getting scratched.
- Mm-hmm.

490
00:32:38,952 --> 00:32:43,605
Different areas of the hotel
were having situations where...

491
00:32:43,606 --> 00:32:46,547
People are actually
physically being scratched,

492
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:49,382
drawing blood, and so
I'm getting concerned.

493
00:32:49,383 --> 00:32:52,296
You know, my employees are
freaking out. They're being touched.

494
00:32:52,297 --> 00:32:55,458
And, so, that's kind of
why I called you guys.

495
00:32:55,459 --> 00:32:58,055
We may go belly-up.

496
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:01,071
Well, let me tell you
about the woman that ran

497
00:33:01,072 --> 00:33:04,441
this town, basically,
before this hotel was built.

498
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:07,219
Her name was Shotgun
Kitty. She was 4'11...

499
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,751
- She weighed over 200 pounds...
- Okay.

500
00:33:09,752 --> 00:33:14,080
And I got a photo of her
actually in her younger days.

501
00:33:14,081 --> 00:33:16,415
Now, the reason she was called
Shotgun Kitty is because she

502
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:18,977
always carried a shotgun with
her, and when she ran the brothels,

503
00:33:18,978 --> 00:33:22,657
she was always breaking up fights
between the miners and the prostitutes.

504
00:33:22,658 --> 00:33:26,086
She didn't take no crap from nobody.

505
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:29,678
So, do you think this
might be the woman you see?

506
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,939
Granted, she's much older when
I saw her, but other than that...

507
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,340
I think so.

508
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:48,928
So, the next thing I saw was a
confrontation between two men.

509
00:33:48,929 --> 00:33:51,377
This was in the 70s or the 80s.

510
00:33:51,378 --> 00:33:55,373
So, this one man is
sitting in the room...

511
00:33:55,374 --> 00:34:00,106
And this other man comes
charging into the room and...

512
00:34:00,107 --> 00:34:03,227
Shot him in the head.

513
00:34:04,739 --> 00:34:08,379
So, he's a little confused about...

514
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:14,280
What ended up happening, so he
kind of stumbles around that area.

515
00:34:15,088 --> 00:34:19,207
I mean, there was only one
mysterious death in this area.

516
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:21,830
Back in the time frame you're
talking about, that we uncovered.

517
00:34:21,831 --> 00:34:27,222
Back in '76, a guy named William
Thomas Moore went missing in July.

518
00:34:27,223 --> 00:34:30,745
I have his death certificate here.

519
00:34:30,746 --> 00:34:35,498
He was found two months
later in the sewage plant.

520
00:34:35,499 --> 00:34:37,093
Right on the property here.

521
00:34:37,094 --> 00:34:39,147
His body was so decomposed
that they actually had to

522
00:34:39,148 --> 00:34:42,332
go through dental records
to identify who he was.

523
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:47,327
There's local folklore
going around that prior to...

524
00:34:47,328 --> 00:34:53,228
Moore being found dead, there was an
argument and that he might've been shot.

525
00:34:54,752 --> 00:34:57,109
So, how'd the rest of your
walk go? What did you see?

526
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:00,590
So, the next part is um...

527
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,097
The hallway.

528
00:35:02,098 --> 00:35:04,519
They have a name for that
area called Spooky Hollow.

529
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,073
So, there were a lot of
upset and angry dead people.

530
00:35:08,074 --> 00:35:11,208
They're sick and tired of
being messed with by the living.

531
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:15,232
They feel like they're being tortured.

532
00:35:15,233 --> 00:35:18,441
They said that there had been
a lot of investigations here.

533
00:35:18,442 --> 00:35:23,213
The living were messing with the
dead here in a very negative manner.

534
00:35:23,214 --> 00:35:27,723
I could actually see where that might be a
possibility because we do have people that

535
00:35:27,724 --> 00:35:31,744
do come here and do investigations.

536
00:35:31,778 --> 00:35:34,998
And I didn't realize
that it would affect uh...

537
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:37,369
The non-living in that way.

538
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:40,758
I've been saying all
along to leave them alone.

539
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:45,144
Because it would bug me, living,
to have somebody constantly...

540
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:47,246
- In your face?
- Yeah.

541
00:35:47,247 --> 00:35:51,150
So, I did a sketch of
the people that are here.

542
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:56,269
Um, some are angry, and
some are asking for help.

543
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:59,630
There's a hallway, and...

544
00:35:59,676 --> 00:36:03,395
There's fifteen, twenty people.

545
00:36:03,396 --> 00:36:07,356
And they're all not looking good.

546
00:36:10,243 --> 00:36:14,443
Well, that's... that's pretty creepy.

547
00:36:22,361 --> 00:36:24,247
Got a lot of people there.

548
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:25,334
Wow.

549
00:36:25,335 --> 00:36:28,820
There was one man who confronted me.

550
00:36:28,821 --> 00:36:32,781
He stood out from a lot of them.

551
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:38,533
He's very advanced and very
powerful, and he's very upset.

552
00:36:38,534 --> 00:36:41,894
He despises living people.

553
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:46,177
He kind of runs the dead back here.

554
00:36:46,178 --> 00:36:50,275
And he's the one who really lashes out.

555
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:53,701
There's an area here... it's at
the very end of Spooky Hollow...

556
00:36:53,702 --> 00:36:57,839
Where I'm confronted by this individual.

557
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,207
And it's overwhelming to me.

558
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:04,515
I don't go back there because I
feel like I'm invading somebody...

559
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:07,898
It's going into somebody else's home you're
not welcome to... like, that feeling.

560
00:37:07,899 --> 00:37:10,417
That's not good.

561
00:37:10,418 --> 00:37:12,126
What's the story with this guy?

562
00:37:12,127 --> 00:37:17,717
He... was not very good in life
and took whatever he wanted in life.

563
00:37:17,718 --> 00:37:22,028
And he wanted a lot of
power, and he wanted respect.

564
00:37:22,029 --> 00:37:26,768
I felt his death, and I felt
that it was from strangulation.

565
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:29,409
- You're kidding, really?
- Yep.

566
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:32,000
There was a man who worked and
lived here who was a janitor

567
00:37:32,001 --> 00:37:36,082
that actually hung himself right
in this hallway back in 1947.

568
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:39,740
It's interesting that you talk about
this. This is the guy here, Thomas Blower.

569
00:37:39,741 --> 00:37:43,515
He waited until everybody went on their
lunch break, and he came back here,

570
00:37:43,516 --> 00:37:46,428
and he hung himself.

571
00:37:46,429 --> 00:37:50,561
The funny part about this guy is when
I talked to an historian about him,

572
00:37:50,562 --> 00:37:54,631
before he was a janitor, he used to
travel the world with quite a bit of money.

573
00:37:54,632 --> 00:38:00,356
And he was checking into Canada in
1924, he had $2,500 in cash on him.

574
00:38:00,357 --> 00:38:03,051
Which was basically a
fortune back in 1924.

575
00:38:03,052 --> 00:38:07,012
I actually have the manifest here.

576
00:38:07,476 --> 00:38:10,009
Now, you said the guy
wanted power and respect.

577
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:13,374
The guy I talked to said he
may have been a highway robber.

578
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:16,092
To come across that kind of
money didn't make any sense.

579
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:19,886
So, here's a guy that was probably a
thief in life, robbed a lot of people.

580
00:38:19,887 --> 00:38:25,528
But he died broke working as a janitor
right here and then hanging himself.

581
00:38:25,529 --> 00:38:29,908
- Does that make sense to you?
- Well, yeah.

582
00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:32,940
He can make you feel true fear.

583
00:38:32,941 --> 00:38:37,124
He can reach into your mind
and project back what will...

584
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:40,538
Make you scared, and it
makes you want to run.

585
00:38:40,539 --> 00:38:44,068
And he is a fighter, and he
absolutely has no intention of leaving.

586
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:47,907
He's sick of the living
messing with him, and...

587
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:52,108
He is absolutely ready to fight back.

588
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,788
He wants to drive the
living out of this place.

589
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:15,543
And he's sick of the living
messing with him, and...

590
00:39:15,544 --> 00:39:19,744
He is absolutely ready to fight back.

591
00:39:25,476 --> 00:39:29,093
How frightening is this for you?

592
00:39:29,094 --> 00:39:33,121
Last time I went back here,
somebody followed me...

593
00:39:33,122 --> 00:39:36,062
All the way around.

594
00:39:36,293 --> 00:39:40,271
And they kept touching, and
I never came back here again.

595
00:39:40,272 --> 00:39:41,215
Mm-hmm.

596
00:39:41,216 --> 00:39:44,571
There's places I just
straight will not go...

597
00:39:44,572 --> 00:39:48,052
Day, night, doesn't matter.

598
00:39:54,486 --> 00:39:57,103
I know we gave you a lot
of information tonight.

599
00:39:57,104 --> 00:40:00,789
But the reason you brought us in is,
is it safe for you guys to be here,

600
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:04,963
for your employees to be here, and,
really, most importantly, your guests.

601
00:40:04,964 --> 00:40:10,864
For that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy
and see if she's got an answer for us.

602
00:40:12,341 --> 00:40:17,961
This place was so occupied by the
dead and the residual energy...

603
00:40:17,962 --> 00:40:22,222
That there's, like, no room for life.

604
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:27,948
This could be a place where,

605
00:40:27,949 --> 00:40:32,681
instead of having Ghost Hunters
come, you have people who...

606
00:40:32,682 --> 00:40:35,202
Are spiritual.

607
00:40:35,413 --> 00:40:39,189
Now, you're going to need
a few various holy men,

608
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,981
and they need to do
funerals and blessings.

609
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:46,104
Does it matter what denomination
the priest or the pastor is?

610
00:40:46,105 --> 00:40:48,370
No, it doesn't really matter.

611
00:40:48,371 --> 00:40:51,824
They're each going to do
a different type of ritual,

612
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:55,581
blessing, cleansing,
or moving on process.

613
00:40:55,582 --> 00:40:59,563
It will clear a substantial
amount of people out of here.

614
00:40:59,564 --> 00:41:03,626
But there's still going to be
people who don't want to leave,

615
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:08,717
or people who don't click with
anybody, people who just want to stay.

616
00:41:08,718 --> 00:41:12,426
So, the angry guy that's back here,
will he stay or will he move on?

617
00:41:12,427 --> 00:41:15,900
Oh, he's gonna be thrilled
about what we're talking about.

618
00:41:15,901 --> 00:41:20,372
He wants to stay, but he
wants to be left alone.

619
00:41:20,373 --> 00:41:25,808
You know, the ghost hunting's have just
got to stop, or it's gonna get worse.

620
00:41:25,809 --> 00:41:26,989
Okay.

621
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:29,753
I think we need to come back here
and talk to the spirits a little bit

622
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:32,674
and apologize and move it forward.

623
00:41:32,675 --> 00:41:34,365
So, is that why it got crazy here?

624
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:37,076
- Because they were, like, fed up?
- They're done. Yeah.

625
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,414
And, I mean, this isn't
gonna happen overnight.

626
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:41,423
But if in the long run it gets better...

627
00:41:41,424 --> 00:41:43,995
- Then that's good.
- Yeah.

628
00:41:43,996 --> 00:41:46,384
Let's get started now.

629
00:41:46,385 --> 00:41:49,281
I think it has started.

630
00:41:49,282 --> 00:41:51,594
With all of the dead
surrounding this location,

631
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:54,628
Rich and Mary Lee have
their work cut out for them.

632
00:41:54,629 --> 00:41:57,405
But I'm confident that
if they follow my advice,

633
00:41:57,406 --> 00:42:03,306
they should be able to keep their
employees and guests safe from harm.
