1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
David Coleman.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,369
Tonight on "Dead Files Revisited"...

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,259
****!

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,265
A second look at some of Amy and
Steve's most terrifying cases.

5
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:15,467
- That didn't freak you out?
- New information...

6
00:00:15,468 --> 00:00:17,770
I was the most afraid
that I've ever been.

7
00:00:17,771 --> 00:00:19,571
Startling revelations.

8
00:00:19,572 --> 00:00:21,106
I was part of the problem.

9
00:00:21,107 --> 00:00:24,468
First, a return to
Huntington, West Virginia...

10
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:26,106
I did hear, "murder".

11
00:00:26,107 --> 00:00:28,760
Where a dentist struggles
to save his practice.

12
00:00:28,761 --> 00:00:30,568
He said, "get out of here".

13
00:00:30,569 --> 00:00:34,556
And Amy and Steve uncover the
truth behind a mysterious death.

14
00:00:34,557 --> 00:00:37,137
He killed her.

15
00:00:37,803 --> 00:00:41,640
Then, we travel back
to Garrett, Indiana...

16
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,675
I am scared to death to
be down here right now.

17
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:46,445
To reopen a case so disturbing...

18
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,580
Something's in bed with them.

19
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:51,628
It pushed a client over the edge.

20
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:55,283
Did they listen to Amy or
continue to live in fear?

21
00:00:55,284 --> 00:01:00,759
There's no way that you can prepare
for whatever Amy's gonna tell you.

22
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,892
They're being watched.

23
00:01:02,893 --> 00:01:05,964
My name is Amy Allan.

24
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:08,200
This thing likes death.

25
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:09,807
I see dead people.

26
00:01:09,808 --> 00:01:11,357
This thing's, like, a monster.

27
00:01:11,358 --> 00:01:13,572
I speak to dead people.

28
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,107
And he's pissed off now.

29
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,657
And they speak to me.

30
00:01:16,658 --> 00:01:18,379
His head was cracked.

31
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,913
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

32
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:23,282
This guy was murdered.

33
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,867
I rely on my partner.

34
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:28,287
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

35
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,822
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

36
00:01:30,823 --> 00:01:34,159
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

37
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,594
You saw her?

38
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,795
It's my job to reveal them.

39
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:37,829
Why would you stay here?

40
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,110
But Steve and I never speak...

41
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:42,234
We never communicate
during an investigation.

42
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,635
Until the very end.

43
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:45,471
Stop it.

44
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,375
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

45
00:01:47,376 --> 00:01:49,941
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

46
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:51,243
Or time to get out.

47
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:55,984
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

48
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,413
Like most people, I'm no
fan of going to the dentist,

49
00:02:13,414 --> 00:02:17,392
and our investigation into the office of
Dr. Grimes in Huntington, West Virginia,

50
00:02:17,393 --> 00:02:19,426
didn't make me any more comfortable.

51
00:02:19,427 --> 00:02:23,458
The doc had concerns that paranormal
activity might ruin his business,

52
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,779
but what disturbed me was how attached
he'd become to the ghost of a little girl.

53
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,582
And after what Amy and I
found out in our investigation,

54
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:35,387
I'm pretty sure the doc
will never be the same again.

55
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:38,049
So, Dr. Grimes, what's going on?

56
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,125
We have a problem here.

57
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:43,328
I've been in this building
for nearly 40 years.

58
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,766
Starting out, things were just
noises that could be dismissed,

59
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,564
but I no longer have just sounds.

60
00:02:50,565 --> 00:02:53,087
I have visual things going on.

61
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:55,689
As far as your employees go, I
mean, how are they dealing with it?

62
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:00,132
They're afraid of it. They
won't go upstairs at night.

63
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:02,472
I called Steve and Amy because,

64
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:08,187
it really bothered me that my staff were
afraid to come upstairs in my own office.

65
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,502
And the fact that I can't seem to do
anything about it is even more of a problem

66
00:03:11,503 --> 00:03:14,336
because I'm supposed to be able to
handle these problems, and I'm not.

67
00:03:14,337 --> 00:03:16,307
It is, after all, my building.

68
00:03:16,308 --> 00:03:20,057
Are you concerned that whatever's
going on here is dangerous?

69
00:03:20,058 --> 00:03:25,958
Yes. It's my concern that I could
actually frighten my patients away.

70
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,910
I...

71
00:03:43,592 --> 00:03:46,992
Have this elderly gentleman with me.

72
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:50,293
He's really tall, and...

73
00:03:50,354 --> 00:03:54,198
Something happened,
but I'm not sure what.

74
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:58,974
I knew it was a bad sign, seeing that old
man waiting for me outside the location.

75
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:00,673
He wanted to keep me from going in,

76
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:04,768
but I wasn't going to let him stop
me from figuring out the truth.

77
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:08,609
Something happened in his office.

78
00:04:08,691 --> 00:04:13,431
I did hear, "murder,
murder, murder, murder".

79
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:18,052
Okay, so what's going on in here?

80
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:21,755
This was a place where I started
seeing the vision of a little girl.

81
00:04:21,756 --> 00:04:25,541
In fact, she was standing right
there at that door on the stairwell.

82
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:27,517
- Could you describe her for me?
- Yes, I can.

83
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:30,842
As a matter of fact, I've painted
a painting of her several years ago,

84
00:04:30,843 --> 00:04:33,093
and I have it right here.

85
00:04:33,094 --> 00:04:36,152
As you can see, she's very sad.

86
00:04:36,153 --> 00:04:39,740
I have tried very hard
to reach out to her.

87
00:04:39,741 --> 00:04:43,954
Because of the empathy I feel for her.

88
00:04:43,955 --> 00:04:45,846
I've interviewed a lot of clients

89
00:04:45,847 --> 00:04:48,001
who say they've tried to
communicate with ghosts.

90
00:04:48,002 --> 00:04:52,742
And usually, things
don't turn out so good.

91
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:59,445
I hate the stairwell.

92
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:01,505
I hate it.

93
00:05:01,506 --> 00:05:04,465
Something in that space...

94
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:07,646
It's not good at all.

95
00:05:08,363 --> 00:05:10,531
With every step I
took up those stairs...

96
00:05:10,532 --> 00:05:12,900
I could feel my stomach
turning in knots.

97
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:18,801
I know now it's because I was
about to see something disturbing.

98
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,193
Someone, like, died, like, right here.

99
00:05:23,194 --> 00:05:26,555
You know, she's, like, a teenager.

100
00:05:26,556 --> 00:05:30,550
And her heart's pounding.
Her heart's pounding.

101
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:32,937
So much pain, and...

102
00:05:32,938 --> 00:05:36,778
She broke her legs or something.

103
00:05:39,758 --> 00:05:43,606
I was walking through this hallway
late one evening, turning things off,

104
00:05:43,607 --> 00:05:46,630
and a voice came to me...
a man's voice, very deep.

105
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:48,706
And he said, "get out of here".

106
00:05:48,707 --> 00:05:51,016
He goes up and down these stairs.

107
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,653
You can hear him stomping, literally.

108
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:59,554
Because of his aggression, I'm concerned
that he might actually hurt somebody.

109
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:04,494
So, she died, like, right here.

110
00:06:04,495 --> 00:06:08,621
This guy is laughing.
He's just laughing.

111
00:06:08,622 --> 00:06:12,068
I sense the large, angry man
was the dead girl's father.

112
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:14,570
And listening to him spew his hatred,

113
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:17,640
there was no question he
completely resented her.

114
00:06:17,641 --> 00:06:19,876
"She was a useless ****.

115
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:24,169
I didn't have a use for her anymore".

116
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,750
He killed her.

117
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:28,881
****

118
00:06:28,882 --> 00:06:31,642
What the ****?

119
00:06:34,626 --> 00:06:35,883
What happened?

120
00:06:35,884 --> 00:06:38,344
He poked me.

121
00:06:38,396 --> 00:06:42,789
He doesn't want me to
really talk about it.

122
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,690
Because he got mad and ran away.

123
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,300
After talking to Dr. Grimes' daughter,

124
00:06:54,301 --> 00:06:57,586
I found out his whole family
had seen the same little girl.

125
00:06:57,587 --> 00:07:01,808
So, I decided to see if someone outside
the family could corroborate their story.

126
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:04,411
I tracked down one of the
doc's former employees.

127
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:06,721
She was reluctant to
meet me at the office,

128
00:07:06,722 --> 00:07:11,762
and after hearing her
story, I don't blame her.

129
00:07:17,157 --> 00:07:18,759
The doctor himself, I mean,

130
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,785
he explained some bizarre things
that he's experienced here.

131
00:07:21,786 --> 00:07:23,269
Now, how about yourself?

132
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:28,222
I was assisting Dr. Grimes
in doing a root canal.

133
00:07:28,223 --> 00:07:30,462
And I glanced up.

134
00:07:30,463 --> 00:07:34,558
And there was a girl standing
right behind where you're standing.

135
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:36,360
I will never forget it.

136
00:07:36,361 --> 00:07:38,829
I can see it's upsetting for
you to even be in the building.

137
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,786
This room doesn't bother me as bad...

138
00:07:42,787 --> 00:07:45,727
As a room upstairs.

139
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:52,824
I went up to get a file, and I could
feel someone in that room with me.

140
00:07:52,893 --> 00:07:54,927
- Did you see anything?
- No.

141
00:07:54,928 --> 00:07:57,219
I just felt it.

142
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,300
I felt like something came over me.

143
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:02,642
Like...

144
00:08:02,643 --> 00:08:06,243
Like someone was watching me.

145
00:08:06,342 --> 00:08:07,583
Coming up next...

146
00:08:07,584 --> 00:08:09,942
This guy is just laughing.

147
00:08:09,943 --> 00:08:12,578
Amy confronts a sadistic spirit.

148
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:15,415
He tossed her over.

149
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,450
And in our second investigation...

150
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:19,111
- What's coming in?
- Death.

151
00:08:19,112 --> 00:08:21,965
Ordinary people face off against evil.

152
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:26,706
I was the most afraid
that I've ever been.

153
00:08:35,651 --> 00:08:38,920
Looking into the history of
Dr. Grimes' dental practice,

154
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:41,856
it wasn't long before I
uncovered a death in the building.

155
00:08:41,857 --> 00:08:44,968
According to newspaper
articles from 1929,

156
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:49,364
a 21-year-old girl named
Lavina Wall died after a fall.

157
00:08:49,365 --> 00:08:52,288
The details about her death were vague.

158
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:58,189
So I met with an expert who ended up
changing my whole perspective on the case.

159
00:09:02,111 --> 00:09:05,780
Lavina was sort of a woman of mystery.

160
00:09:05,781 --> 00:09:08,617
Her story was a very tragic one.

161
00:09:08,618 --> 00:09:10,877
Her mother, Bernice...

162
00:09:10,878 --> 00:09:15,164
Was married to this
gentleman named Cyrus.

163
00:09:15,165 --> 00:09:15,969
Okay.

164
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,878
Apparently, he liked
to drink, and when he

165
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:21,946
was drunk, he liked to beat on his wife.

166
00:09:21,947 --> 00:09:27,785
And then in 1913, Lavina, her
elder sister, and her mother...

167
00:09:27,786 --> 00:09:32,308
Left and moved into the duplex
on 20th street in Huntington.

168
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:34,974
- Where Dr. Grimes' office is now?
- Exactly.

169
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,213
We don't know if the father ever
came back or tried to find them or...

170
00:09:38,214 --> 00:09:40,854
We don't know.

171
00:09:45,258 --> 00:09:48,291
I feel like there's...

172
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:51,532
People that are arguing.

173
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:57,120
There's a male, and he's a liar,
and there is the two ladies.

174
00:09:57,121 --> 00:09:59,409
And he's chasing...

175
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,830
Like, he's following them.

176
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:07,893
Every time I saw the dead girl's
father, he was surrounded by violence.

177
00:10:07,894 --> 00:10:12,694
And she wasn't the
only target of his rage.

178
00:10:12,808 --> 00:10:15,148
His wife...

179
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,981
Ran away, because he's coming
in and he's pissed off now.

180
00:10:19,982 --> 00:10:23,218
This is happening right now?

181
00:10:23,219 --> 00:10:25,139
Yeah.

182
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:30,890
Once I realized how screwed
up Lavina's father was,

183
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:34,230
I needed to clear up some
important details about her death.

184
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:38,968
It says she died from a fall, but the
articles are vague and they just...

185
00:10:38,969 --> 00:10:43,341
The articles are not just
vague, they are contradictory.

186
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:44,537
Right.

187
00:10:44,538 --> 00:10:47,854
I have here her death certificate...

188
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,935
Which actually says that she died...

189
00:10:50,936 --> 00:10:54,263
From acute alcohol poisoning.

190
00:10:54,264 --> 00:10:57,303
So, death certificate says one thing,
the newspaper articles say another.

191
00:10:57,304 --> 00:10:59,884
- Yes.
- Okay.

192
00:11:05,128 --> 00:11:07,029
Her legs are messed up.

193
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:10,210
There was a pain here.

194
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:14,553
A really bad pain here, like a crunch.

195
00:11:14,902 --> 00:11:19,762
And this guy is laughing.
He's just laughing.

196
00:11:21,063 --> 00:11:23,714
Do you think this was an accident?

197
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:25,315
No.

198
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:28,376
He's happy about it.

199
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:31,619
I think...

200
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:35,687
He threw her down.

201
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:40,402
I think he tossed her over.

202
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:46,486
At this point, I had uncovered
two causes of death for Lavina...

203
00:11:46,487 --> 00:11:49,245
A fall down the stairs
and alcohol poisoning.

204
00:11:49,246 --> 00:11:51,080
But which one was it?

205
00:11:51,081 --> 00:11:54,284
It wasn't until I called on one
of the County's top paramedics

206
00:11:54,285 --> 00:12:00,185
that I realized these two causes
of death might've been related.

207
00:12:04,194 --> 00:12:08,164
So, Steve, the death certificate lists
alcohol poisoning as the cause of death.

208
00:12:08,165 --> 00:12:10,912
Now, it's 1929, so this is prohibition.

209
00:12:10,913 --> 00:12:16,813
Right. The federal government was still
producing alcohol for medicinal purposes.

210
00:12:16,906 --> 00:12:21,344
And they would put small traces
of poison in that alcohol...

211
00:12:21,345 --> 00:12:25,014
To prevent people from using
it as a recreational drink.

212
00:12:25,015 --> 00:12:28,618
So, Steve, if she started to ingest
this poison liquor, what would happen?

213
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:31,621
As she swallows it, it's gonna cause
burning going down her esophagus,

214
00:12:31,622 --> 00:12:34,524
down into her stomach, and it's
gonna aggravate her stomach lining.

215
00:12:34,525 --> 00:12:37,059
Would moonshine cause
that same type of symptom?

216
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,920
Yes.

217
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:42,331
Death certificate says one thing,
the newspaper articles say another,

218
00:12:42,332 --> 00:12:43,884
so I wanted to get your opinion.

219
00:12:43,885 --> 00:12:47,856
It looks like Miss Wall either
was drinking, fell down the steps,

220
00:12:47,857 --> 00:12:51,038
suffered some type of head
injury or internal bleeding.

221
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,473
Or she had fallen, and
after she had fallen,

222
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:57,490
she may have been trying
to lessen that pain

223
00:12:57,491 --> 00:13:00,383
by using, whether it be
legal or illegal spirits.

224
00:13:00,384 --> 00:13:02,304
Okay.

225
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:09,642
The daughter that died on the stairs...

226
00:13:09,643 --> 00:13:13,843
There was a sickness with the throat.

227
00:13:13,897 --> 00:13:17,737
It's really this intense pain...

228
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:19,908
Going all the way down.

229
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:24,040
And it's all raw and burning like that.

230
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:28,377
The image of that girl's death was so
horrific, I couldn't get it out of my head.

231
00:13:28,378 --> 00:13:32,044
That's why I decided to sketch the man
who was responsible for killing her...

232
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,385
Her father.

233
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:44,979
He's approximately sixty to sixty-five.

234
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:48,786
He has a very rugged...

235
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:51,427
Thick skin.

236
00:13:51,903 --> 00:13:56,103
His hair... it's a nice silver gray.

237
00:13:58,492 --> 00:14:01,912
Amy, is this who you saw?

238
00:14:03,484 --> 00:14:04,911
Yes.

239
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:05,941
Next...

240
00:14:05,942 --> 00:14:07,787
She was dead.

241
00:14:07,788 --> 00:14:10,957
Amy and Steve reveal
their disturbing findings.

242
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,992
My God.

243
00:14:12,993 --> 00:14:16,028
But did the client follow Amy's advice?

244
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:20,649
So I thought I was
doing the right thing.

245
00:14:37,932 --> 00:14:41,494
When I first saw Amy, I was
beginning to get concerned.

246
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:46,099
This practice is my
life. It's my livelihood.

247
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,561
This is where I have staked my past.
It's where I have staked my future.

248
00:14:50,562 --> 00:14:53,803
Dr. Grimes thinks he may
be losing patients because

249
00:14:53,804 --> 00:14:59,704
of some of the things going on there,
and he needs to know what's happening.

250
00:15:00,672 --> 00:15:03,312
So, I started going up
one of the staircases.

251
00:15:03,313 --> 00:15:06,493
And I saw this girl...

252
00:15:06,775 --> 00:15:09,069
Laying there and...

253
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,590
She was dead.

254
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:15,418
She was in absolute agony.

255
00:15:17,044 --> 00:15:20,801
There was a young girl that did die.

256
00:15:20,802 --> 00:15:24,340
Back in 1929. Her name was Lavina Wall.

257
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:27,139
The newspaper articles
say she died from a fall.

258
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,875
My gosh. Really?

259
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:33,812
You know, you've had an instance
where you've seen a young girl.

260
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:37,416
I would turn and look at the doorway
at the top of the stairwell...

261
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:40,785
And I would see a
flash of a little girl.

262
00:15:40,786 --> 00:15:43,776
I could see pain in her eyes.

263
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:48,589
And a longing for someone
to understand that pain.

264
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:54,490
I did do a sketch of the scene
that I saw on the staircase.

265
00:16:02,707 --> 00:16:04,903
My God.

266
00:16:04,904 --> 00:16:08,296
The picture that Amy presented to me...

267
00:16:08,297 --> 00:16:12,151
Shocked me. It shook me to my very bone.

268
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:14,993
It was almost like I fell
down the stairs with her.

269
00:16:14,994 --> 00:16:16,716
There she was...

270
00:16:16,717 --> 00:16:19,591
In pain, suffering.

271
00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:22,900
And that was what she had
tried to tell me for decades.

272
00:16:22,901 --> 00:16:25,897
The good doctor here is quite a painter.

273
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:30,098
He actually painted a picture of her.

274
00:16:32,717 --> 00:16:34,877
Wow.

275
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:39,910
- So, you think it's her?
- Without a doubt.

276
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:42,603
Seeing that painting, I
could tell Dr. Grimes had

277
00:16:42,604 --> 00:16:45,817
a strong connection with the
spirit of the little girl.

278
00:16:45,818 --> 00:16:47,509
So it didn't come as a surprise,

279
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:51,340
when he told me he was trying
to communicate with her.

280
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:53,858
I don't know if I'm doing
the right thing or not.

281
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:55,961
Is that a good thing or
a bad thing he's doing?

282
00:16:55,962 --> 00:17:00,217
Really bad. We can become
a little too attached.

283
00:17:00,218 --> 00:17:05,575
That attachment can actually be something
else that kind of holds them here.

284
00:17:05,576 --> 00:17:08,006
So, I thought I was
doing the right thing,

285
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:11,610
but I was part of the
problem, not the solution.

286
00:17:11,611 --> 00:17:14,251
And that stung.

287
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:17,682
What else did you see?

288
00:17:17,683 --> 00:17:20,097
Um, I also encountered...

289
00:17:20,098 --> 00:17:22,790
Really negative male.

290
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,935
At the top of the stairs.

291
00:17:25,936 --> 00:17:27,926
Who I believe is her father.

292
00:17:27,927 --> 00:17:31,038
I have heard a man stomping.

293
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,665
- He's aggressive.
- He's very violent.

294
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,426
- Violent?
- Yes.

295
00:17:36,591 --> 00:17:38,990
Her, her mother, and her older sister...

296
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:44,091
Fled Ohio from Cyrus,
their abusive, drunk father.

297
00:17:44,368 --> 00:17:46,708
Okay.

298
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:52,059
So, I did a sketch that
I think might be him.

299
00:17:55,667 --> 00:18:01,427
Look at this photo. Now look
at this sketch. You tell me.

300
00:18:09,778 --> 00:18:15,052
Here was a face on that thing that
was bothering me all those years.

301
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,157
And it was a real person and,

302
00:18:17,158 --> 00:18:22,772
the only thing that I can say
that I responded with was anger.

303
00:18:22,773 --> 00:18:25,053
I think...

304
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,000
He, killed her.

305
00:18:28,902 --> 00:18:33,165
He was at the top of the stairs,
picked her up, and threw her.

306
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,566
My God.

307
00:18:36,843 --> 00:18:40,374
I never even dreamt of that.

308
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,365
It was a shock that
someone that I really knew,

309
00:18:43,366 --> 00:18:46,419
really cared about over
a long period of time

310
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,822
had suffered something worse
than I had ever dreamed.

311
00:18:49,823 --> 00:18:55,043
It was murder, and it was
a brutal, brutal murder.

312
00:18:55,098 --> 00:19:00,129
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy, and
hopefully, she will have an answer.

313
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:04,746
The first thing that I would
recommend is getting rid of her father.

314
00:19:04,747 --> 00:19:07,311
The next step is going to be...

315
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:11,527
Having a talk with her
and letting her know...

316
00:19:11,528 --> 00:19:14,985
That it's okay for her to go.

317
00:19:14,986 --> 00:19:16,703
Doc, are you gonna
be able to let her go?

318
00:19:16,704 --> 00:19:22,604
Because you're really, like, almost
a fatherly figure right now with her.

319
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,711
Amy gave me very explicit instructions

320
00:19:43,712 --> 00:19:47,030
as to how I could rid the
office of Lavina's father.

321
00:19:47,031 --> 00:19:50,913
I decided that I would have to wait
until everyone was out of the office.

322
00:19:50,914 --> 00:19:53,789
None of the employees, no patients.

323
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,550
Just me and him.

324
00:19:59,163 --> 00:20:02,399
Amy gave me three objects...
she gave me black salt,

325
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,459
some holy water, and some incense.

326
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,161
As I was going through
this ritual of cleansing,

327
00:20:08,162 --> 00:20:14,062
I could feel like the pall of sadness
had been lifted from this place.

328
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:20,380
I could feel something that
was enlightening and lifting.

329
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:26,542
After I got rid of her father, there was
a big difference in the way Lavina acted.

330
00:20:26,543 --> 00:20:32,123
I heard her laugh for the
first time ever in 38 years.

331
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:37,290
The next step was a
sit-down talk with Lavina,

332
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:43,025
and I explained to her that it was time
for her now to move on to a better place.

333
00:20:43,026 --> 00:20:48,496
And since then, I feel that
she might have done just that.

334
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,333
I don't feel her like I used to.

335
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:55,937
And to find that I'm
alone now and she's gone,

336
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:59,126
that's something of a sad thought.

337
00:20:59,127 --> 00:21:03,027
It's like letting your child go.

338
00:21:03,518 --> 00:21:06,363
I know all too well that severing
a connection with the dead

339
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:11,283
can be just as painful as
saying goodbye to a loved one.

340
00:21:11,284 --> 00:21:15,654
For Dr. Grimes, it's been a difficult
journey to accept that Lavina's gone,

341
00:21:15,655 --> 00:21:21,555
and I can only hope he'll find comfort in
knowing that her soul is finally at peace.

342
00:21:36,243 --> 00:21:39,291
Buying a home is every
newlywed couple's dream,

343
00:21:39,292 --> 00:21:42,080
unless you're our clients
in Garrett, Indiana.

344
00:21:42,081 --> 00:21:44,025
Leah's new house terrified her.

345
00:21:44,026 --> 00:21:48,455
And her husband, Rudy, refused to believe
in the existence of anything paranormal.

346
00:21:48,456 --> 00:21:50,715
Until Amy blew them all away.

347
00:21:50,716 --> 00:21:54,838
Revealing what really
happened inside their house.

348
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:57,281
So, Leah, why don't you
tell me what's going on?

349
00:21:57,282 --> 00:22:01,449
I am hearing things.
Stuff is touching us.

350
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:05,801
We can't sleep at night. My
family won't even come over.

351
00:22:05,802 --> 00:22:09,241
We really want to start a
family, but I am not comfortable

352
00:22:09,242 --> 00:22:12,397
raising kids in a house
that I'm afraid to be in.

353
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:13,996
So, what about your husband, Rudy?

354
00:22:13,997 --> 00:22:17,231
He does not believe in any of this.

355
00:22:17,232 --> 00:22:20,034
I feel like I'm alone.

356
00:22:20,035 --> 00:22:25,543
Without anyone else here to talk
about it, I felt almost like...

357
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:29,151
"What if I'm crazy? What if this
stuff really isn't happening?"

358
00:22:29,152 --> 00:22:31,612
And I started, then, to feel hopeless...

359
00:22:31,613 --> 00:22:37,513
Like no one else is ever gonna
believe these stories that I'm telling.

360
00:22:38,581 --> 00:22:39,681
You okay?

361
00:22:39,682 --> 00:22:42,799
- Yeah.
- Just hold my hand.

362
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,669
What is it about this basement that
creeps you out, what's going on?

363
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,643
I am scared to death to
be down here right now.

364
00:22:48,644 --> 00:22:51,308
Even with me right now?

365
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:53,799
You know the feeling when
someone's watching you,

366
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,729
and you can't see them
but you know they're there?

367
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:00,150
I feel, like, eyes on me.

368
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:21,487
Not too welcoming.

369
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:25,924
As soon as I walked into the house,

370
00:23:25,925 --> 00:23:29,243
I felt a heavy, dark energy
drawing me into the basement,

371
00:23:29,244 --> 00:23:34,437
and what was waiting down
there nearly made me pass out.

372
00:23:34,438 --> 00:23:38,109
I feel really dizzy, I feel really...

373
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:41,170
Anxious, panicked.

374
00:23:41,874 --> 00:23:45,414
There's lots of people.

375
00:23:48,497 --> 00:23:52,051
There's something down here that...

376
00:23:52,052 --> 00:23:54,632
Draws them in.

377
00:23:58,774 --> 00:24:03,050
There's an old man who
is wandering around.

378
00:24:03,051 --> 00:24:04,874
Lost.

379
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:08,416
Definitely there's...
the entrance is down here.

380
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:10,043
What do you mean?

381
00:24:10,044 --> 00:24:12,738
Where they're coming in.

382
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:15,559
What's coming in?

383
00:24:16,964 --> 00:24:18,944
Death.

384
00:24:18,961 --> 00:24:19,938
Next...

385
00:24:19,939 --> 00:24:23,153
It wants to chop them
up and mutilate them.

386
00:24:23,154 --> 00:24:25,208
Amy fights for her life.

387
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:31,109
It's, like, trying to get my heart.
This thing is, like, really attacking me.

388
00:24:39,073 --> 00:24:41,396
Amy and I were
investigating a home where a

389
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:45,015
young woman was having some
traumatizing experiences.

390
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,150
What she encountered in her bedroom

391
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:50,694
had left her terrified
and desperate for answers.

392
00:24:50,695 --> 00:24:52,425
I was laying in bed one night,

393
00:24:52,426 --> 00:24:54,589
and I just had the urge
to look at the doorway.

394
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:59,159
And I seen a woman standing
there. She was just looking at me.

395
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,765
When I would think about this lady
watching me while I'm sleeping...

396
00:25:03,766 --> 00:25:07,669
I really felt like my
privacy was invaded.

397
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:10,196
- How are you sleeping at night?
- I don't.

398
00:25:10,197 --> 00:25:14,249
I think she's mad
because this is her house.

399
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,585
You think she's dangerous?

400
00:25:16,586 --> 00:25:18,506
Yeah.

401
00:25:20,857 --> 00:25:22,858
I feel like...

402
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:25,463
There's so much, like...

403
00:25:25,464 --> 00:25:27,804
Wrong here.

404
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:30,633
This...

405
00:25:30,634 --> 00:25:32,434
Woman.

406
00:25:32,435 --> 00:25:34,655
She is...

407
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:36,929
Confused.

408
00:25:38,274 --> 00:25:41,426
Does this woman... does she
interact with the living in any way?

409
00:25:41,427 --> 00:25:44,557
Yes. She tries to help them.

410
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:46,546
She thinks they're afraid of her.

411
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:49,925
She says there's real monsters.

412
00:25:49,926 --> 00:25:52,810
She said, that will meet them.

413
00:25:52,811 --> 00:25:56,558
Whoever this woman was, she
wanted to protect the living.

414
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:02,459
Unfortunately, she was no match
for what was hiding in the bedroom.

415
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:09,349
**** me.

416
00:26:12,742 --> 00:26:14,400
Okay.

417
00:26:14,401 --> 00:26:17,446
This is how this thing is getting in.

418
00:26:17,447 --> 00:26:19,080
What thing?

419
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:21,382
This nasty thing.

420
00:26:21,383 --> 00:26:23,332
Looks like a freaking monster.

421
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:28,022
And then it's looking.
It's looking for the people.

422
00:26:28,023 --> 00:26:31,323
It wants to take them...

423
00:26:31,462 --> 00:26:34,162
Into the basement.

424
00:26:34,163 --> 00:26:36,023
Why?

425
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:42,025
It wants to take them down there and,
like, chop them up and mutilate them.

426
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,430
So, Rudy, I was talking
to your wife, Leah,

427
00:26:50,431 --> 00:26:53,230
and she was explaining all the
stuff that's going on in the house.

428
00:26:53,231 --> 00:26:56,162
What about yourself? Have
you experienced anything?

429
00:26:56,163 --> 00:26:59,985
I don't really believe
in all that stuff.

430
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:03,173
But your wife, she's scared to be here.

431
00:27:03,174 --> 00:27:06,490
How do you feel about that? I mean,
you don't seem too concerned about it.

432
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:09,708
Well, there's really not much I can
do about it if there is anything here.

433
00:27:09,709 --> 00:27:11,789
Rudy, let me ask you
something, have you experienced

434
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,664
anything paranormal in this
house, anything unusual?

435
00:27:14,665 --> 00:27:17,587
There was one night I was
sleeping in bed for a couple hours,

436
00:27:17,588 --> 00:27:21,227
and all of a sudden, I
felt something touch me.

437
00:27:21,228 --> 00:27:23,606
And it woke me up.

438
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:25,305
Were you in bed with your wife, or...

439
00:27:25,306 --> 00:27:27,281
No. She wasn't home yet.

440
00:27:27,282 --> 00:27:29,365
- That didn't freak you out?
- No.

441
00:27:29,366 --> 00:27:31,032
Did you tell Leah about this?

442
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:35,324
Yeah. Which, obviously,
was a big mistake.

443
00:27:35,325 --> 00:27:38,828
Rudy's wife was freaking out,
and he didn't seem to care.

444
00:27:38,829 --> 00:27:41,171
I could tell it was gonna take
something pretty terrifying

445
00:27:41,172 --> 00:27:45,000
to get this guy to see the truth.

446
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:47,302
Something's in bed with them.

447
00:27:47,303 --> 00:27:50,363
- What?
- This thing.

448
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,720
Like, maybe black mist.

449
00:27:54,196 --> 00:27:57,016
Or a blob shadow.

450
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,245
But it just moves. You
know what I'm saying?

451
00:28:00,246 --> 00:28:02,649
That house had serious problems...

452
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,768
A dark entity hiding in one room

453
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:07,834
and what seemed to be some kind
of shadow figure in the bedroom.

454
00:28:07,835 --> 00:28:10,960
- This thing is in bed with them?
- Yeah.

455
00:28:10,961 --> 00:28:14,549
It's just, like, this blackness.

456
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:19,590
It just lays there, freaks
them the **** out.

457
00:28:23,373 --> 00:28:25,612
It's not every day you
come across a father

458
00:28:25,613 --> 00:28:28,076
who's more scared of something
than his own daughter.

459
00:28:28,077 --> 00:28:30,614
So when Leah's dad refused
to meet me at the house,

460
00:28:30,615 --> 00:28:36,515
I had to find out what could drive
a grown man to that level of fear.

461
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:44,036
Steve, what's the story with
the house that you won't go in?

462
00:28:44,037 --> 00:28:47,625
It's a bad feeling when
you walk in the door.

463
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:49,670
Have you seen anything in the house?

464
00:28:49,671 --> 00:28:54,012
We went over to feed the dogs one
night while Leah and Rudy were gone.

465
00:28:54,013 --> 00:28:58,384
I walk into the living room, and
I says, "is there anybody here?"

466
00:28:58,385 --> 00:29:00,786
Make some noise if you're here".

467
00:29:00,787 --> 00:29:03,489
And immediately, it was...

468
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,558
Taps on the table.

469
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:08,661
- Okay. Have you been back since?
- No.

470
00:29:08,662 --> 00:29:11,196
- Your daughter's pretty scared.
- I know she is.

471
00:29:11,197 --> 00:29:16,237
- Do you think she's in danger?
- She could be.

472
00:29:17,893 --> 00:29:21,667
This thing can go in your body.

473
00:29:21,668 --> 00:29:25,388
And it can, like, possess you.

474
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,982
Mediums put themselves at risk any
time they connect with an entity.

475
00:29:29,983 --> 00:29:32,785
Sometimes this can be life-threatening.

476
00:29:32,786 --> 00:29:36,173
Now it's, like, grabbing
and trying to get my heart.

477
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,458
- You hear it?
- Yeah.

478
00:29:38,459 --> 00:29:40,577
It's gonna make me sick.

479
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:44,715
This thing is, like,
really attacking me.

480
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:48,901
I was freaking out. The shadow figure
kept trying to force its way into my body,

481
00:29:48,902 --> 00:29:51,942
and I didn't know if I could stop it.

482
00:29:51,943 --> 00:29:56,633
- Do you need to leave?
- No. I got to get this.

483
00:29:56,634 --> 00:29:58,560
****!

484
00:29:58,561 --> 00:30:03,481
I am so not gonna vomit.
You can **** off.

485
00:30:07,054 --> 00:30:08,063
Next...

486
00:30:08,064 --> 00:30:09,481
He had had a heart attack.

487
00:30:09,482 --> 00:30:11,828
Steve uncovers shocking secrets.

488
00:30:11,829 --> 00:30:13,603
How does he wind up with two wives?

489
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:16,449
And what happened
after the investigation?

490
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:20,470
I was ready to fight these things.

491
00:30:33,326 --> 00:30:36,304
After doing some research
on Leah and Rudy's home,

492
00:30:36,305 --> 00:30:42,185
I found out that the previous
owner had died from a stroke.

493
00:30:43,178 --> 00:30:45,145
So, I tracked down his former employer

494
00:30:45,146 --> 00:30:51,046
to see if there might be some kind
of connection to Leah's encounters.

495
00:30:57,864 --> 00:31:00,775
Conducting an investigation
on a house in the neighborhood.

496
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:04,226
I came across the name of a guy named
Ralph, who passed away last year.

497
00:31:04,227 --> 00:31:06,304
- Did you know him?
- Knew him well.

498
00:31:06,305 --> 00:31:08,453
What were the
circumstances of his stroke?

499
00:31:08,454 --> 00:31:11,255
He had it in the house.
He was up in the bedroom.

500
00:31:11,256 --> 00:31:14,850
He had fallen, and, you
know, it was some hours later

501
00:31:14,851 --> 00:31:17,562
before someone came in to find him.

502
00:31:17,563 --> 00:31:20,455
Did he have health issues to begin with?

503
00:31:20,456 --> 00:31:23,900
He had had a heart attack six
or seven years prior to that,

504
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:28,641
but beyond that, he
was a very healthy guy.

505
00:31:33,177 --> 00:31:35,597
There's, like, a male who...

506
00:31:35,598 --> 00:31:37,666
There's something with the heart.

507
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:41,001
Like, a male having a heart attack here.

508
00:31:41,002 --> 00:31:44,439
Having just escaped the shadow
figure who tried to crush my heart,

509
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,843
I wasn't surprised when I encountered a
dead man who experienced the same thing.

510
00:31:48,844 --> 00:31:51,027
I feel it's, like, fairly recent.

511
00:31:51,028 --> 00:31:53,448
Also, like, something with maybe...

512
00:31:53,449 --> 00:31:57,519
Like, I don't know if the heart's
causing, like, little strokes.

513
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:03,420
Something... something with the heart
and strokes, or something like this.

514
00:32:06,996 --> 00:32:09,398
That house was over 100 years old,

515
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:12,133
so I knew there were other residents.

516
00:32:12,134 --> 00:32:14,469
That's how I found
out about Ed Hammers...

517
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:19,274
A rail road worker who was struck and
killed by a train in the early 1900s.

518
00:32:19,275 --> 00:32:22,723
That guy had been married to
two women at the same time,

519
00:32:22,724 --> 00:32:28,624
and the widows ended up battling
it out in court over his estate.

520
00:32:35,436 --> 00:32:38,617
So, I understand this is the courtroom
where this estate trial took place.

521
00:32:38,618 --> 00:32:41,188
Between this guy Ed Hammers' two wives?

522
00:32:41,189 --> 00:32:42,531
Yes, it is. Yeah.

523
00:32:42,532 --> 00:32:44,456
First of all, how does
he wind up with two wives?

524
00:32:44,457 --> 00:32:47,381
Well, he was married to Susan
Hammers and had three children.

525
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:51,548
In fact, he deserted them. In today's
parlance, he'd be a deadbeat dad.

526
00:32:51,549 --> 00:32:57,449
He was arrested for failure to pay child
support on the kids that he deserted.

527
00:32:58,045 --> 00:33:01,743
He met this woman who was
working at the jail, named Carrie,

528
00:33:01,744 --> 00:33:03,829
and fell in love with Carrie.

529
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:06,399
Once he was out of jail, he
decided to get married to her.

530
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,081
What happened at the trial?
I mean, how did it turn out?

531
00:33:09,082 --> 00:33:12,638
Susan, I think, got all of the
damages from an insurance claim.

532
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:16,223
Carrie got the house and
part of the personal property.

533
00:33:16,224 --> 00:33:19,044
Carrie resided in that
home for a few years,

534
00:33:19,045 --> 00:33:22,268
lost it for failure to
pay real-estate taxes.

535
00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:26,670
All I know now is that she's buried
next to Edward Hammers in Garrett.

536
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,591
Okay.

537
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:37,941
This...

538
00:33:38,526 --> 00:33:40,266
This woman.

539
00:33:40,267 --> 00:33:42,589
She feels so...

540
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,510
Lost.

541
00:33:45,113 --> 00:33:47,993
She, like, cries...

542
00:33:48,676 --> 00:33:50,716
Loudly.

543
00:33:51,247 --> 00:33:53,347
Wailing.

544
00:33:54,941 --> 00:33:59,472
She was depressed
in life, very much so.

545
00:33:59,473 --> 00:34:01,939
Do you have any idea why?

546
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:07,220
I don't think she had,
like, a very good marriage,

547
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:12,250
so I don't think she
was ever really... happy.

548
00:34:22,683 --> 00:34:25,362
There was a lot of
activity inside that house,

549
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:28,264
so I felt it was important
to do two sketches.

550
00:34:28,265 --> 00:34:31,969
First the woman who wanted to
protect the people who lived there...

551
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,790
She is very thin.

552
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,777
She has light brown...

553
00:34:37,778 --> 00:34:39,964
Sandy-blond hair.

554
00:34:39,965 --> 00:34:44,169
Then the shadow figure that
physically tormented me.

555
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,638
There's this...

556
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,622
Entity that is in the bed.

557
00:34:49,623 --> 00:34:54,363
I want to just show
the female laying down.

558
00:34:55,814 --> 00:34:58,934
Is this what you saw?

559
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:01,116
Yes.

560
00:35:01,117 --> 00:35:02,289
Coming up next...

561
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,984
That is who I saw.

562
00:35:03,985 --> 00:35:07,765
Amy's sketch reveals pure evil.

563
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:14,278
And for the first time, what
happened after the investigation...

564
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:17,873
I was the most afraid
that I've ever been.

565
00:35:17,874 --> 00:35:21,234
On "Dead Files Revisited".

566
00:35:46,665 --> 00:35:48,469
Leah and Rudy here are newlyweds.

567
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,804
Leah's dad, Steve, won't
even come into the house.

568
00:35:50,805 --> 00:35:53,890
That's why we're doing
the reveal in the garage.

569
00:35:53,891 --> 00:35:57,520
When I was going to meet Amy for the
first time, I was scared to death.

570
00:35:57,521 --> 00:36:00,107
I was concerned that she
wasn't gonna find anything,

571
00:36:00,108 --> 00:36:04,237
and that I was gonna be this crazy
woman living in this crazy house.

572
00:36:04,238 --> 00:36:07,163
I'm gonna have Amy start and tell
us a little bit about her walk.

573
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:11,735
So, the first person that I
encountered was an older man.

574
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:16,862
Either he had a heart attack first,
or it was a stroke and a heart attack.

575
00:36:16,863 --> 00:36:18,575
And this was recent.

576
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:21,949
You know, Amy, it sounds like
the guy you're talking about

577
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:26,449
is this guy, Ralph, who lived here
right before you guys bought the house.

578
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,238
He passed away from a stroke.

579
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:31,655
But he had a heart attack six years prior
to the stroke, so maybe seven years ago?

580
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,516
Yes.

581
00:36:34,282 --> 00:36:38,714
I saw him in the basement, and
he's kind of just lost down there.

582
00:36:38,715 --> 00:36:41,743
There are a lot of
dead people down there.

583
00:36:41,744 --> 00:36:45,844
And it seemed like there
was some type of an entrance,

584
00:36:45,845 --> 00:36:49,416
for these dead people down there.

585
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:52,758
It explains why it feels like I'm
being stared at while I'm down there.

586
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:56,932
It explains the feeling I
get when I walk in the door.

587
00:36:56,933 --> 00:36:58,873
I can feel that.

588
00:36:58,874 --> 00:37:00,986
So, what else happened during your walk?

589
00:37:00,987 --> 00:37:04,767
I went into the laundry room...

590
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,879
And this woman comes out.

591
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,313
There's no way that you can prepare
for whatever Amy's gonna tell you.

592
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:13,373
She was sad.

593
00:37:13,374 --> 00:37:19,254
Really, really, really sad and
really lonely and really lost.

594
00:37:19,431 --> 00:37:23,098
To know that Amy saw the same
lady that I had been seeing,

595
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:26,719
I was relieved that I'm not
crazy, but then I'm like...

596
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,170
"My God. This is real".

597
00:37:29,171 --> 00:37:35,051
I have seen this lady also.
She scares the crap out of me.

598
00:37:35,558 --> 00:37:39,338
Do you want to see the sketch?

599
00:37:39,482 --> 00:37:43,682
You know what? You guys take a look.

600
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:51,565
That is who I saw.

601
00:37:52,613 --> 00:37:56,167
I could tell Leah was relieved by the
fact that we had seen the same woman,

602
00:37:56,168 --> 00:37:58,333
and she wasn't here to hurt her.

603
00:37:58,334 --> 00:38:01,703
Unfortunately, there was a
lot more she needed to know.

604
00:38:01,704 --> 00:38:05,203
I went into the first bedroom and...

605
00:38:05,204 --> 00:38:10,064
I felt this thing come
in through the window.

606
00:38:11,814 --> 00:38:14,583
I just felt like it was negative.

607
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:17,214
Then I went into the second room,

608
00:38:17,215 --> 00:38:22,775
and there I saw, like, this shadowy
figure come out from under the bed,

609
00:38:22,776 --> 00:38:26,320
and then it climbed into the bed.

610
00:38:26,321 --> 00:38:29,808
It can enter people's
bodies fairly easily.

611
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:35,182
I was sleeping, and I felt like something
was holding me or pressing me down.

612
00:38:35,183 --> 00:38:38,001
- Really?
- That sort of thing.

613
00:38:38,002 --> 00:38:42,060
When Amy said that thing
was laying in bed with us,

614
00:38:42,061 --> 00:38:45,847
I think Rudy was shocked, and I
think that's really what pushed him

615
00:38:45,848 --> 00:38:48,603
to want to do something about it.

616
00:38:48,604 --> 00:38:51,420
So, I did do a sketch,

617
00:38:51,421 --> 00:38:56,281
of the main bedroom
and what I saw in there.

618
00:39:07,737 --> 00:39:10,737
That's how I sleep.

619
00:39:11,956 --> 00:39:17,856
That is a little creepy. That is
the side of the bed she sleeps on.

620
00:39:17,975 --> 00:39:22,655
And the shadow thing
is right next to her.

621
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,248
Could this girl be Leah?

622
00:39:25,249 --> 00:39:27,709
It could be.

623
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,690
Can we take a break?

624
00:39:42,191 --> 00:39:44,632
When I started to cry
and I went into the house,

625
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:48,442
I really expected to just be, like, by
myself, and then I heard the door open

626
00:39:48,443 --> 00:39:51,382
and it's Rudy coming through there.

627
00:39:57,887 --> 00:39:59,981
And so, I was, like, relieved.

628
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:03,025
It was the first time that
Rudy really acted like,

629
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:07,648
he's gonna help me and
that he believes now.

630
00:40:07,649 --> 00:40:10,877
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

631
00:40:10,878 --> 00:40:12,955
It's overwhelming.

632
00:40:12,956 --> 00:40:15,444
Well, it's been a long
night, so with that,

633
00:40:15,445 --> 00:40:17,726
I'm gonna turn that over
to Amy for some answers.

634
00:40:17,727 --> 00:40:22,539
I think there's a way
that this can be resolved.

635
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:26,494
What you guys will be doing
is a step-by-step process of...

636
00:40:26,495 --> 00:40:28,945
Releasing the dead.

637
00:40:28,946 --> 00:40:33,455
What this means is that no
dead person, even the nice ones,

638
00:40:33,456 --> 00:40:35,414
are going to be able to remain.

639
00:40:35,415 --> 00:40:40,117
Nothing will ever be able
to enter your house again.

640
00:40:40,118 --> 00:40:41,460
Okay?

641
00:40:41,461 --> 00:40:47,361
You got to make me a promise that
you're gonna do what she tells you.

642
00:40:57,897 --> 00:41:00,109
After Amy told us what we had to do,

643
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:04,538
I was the most afraid
that I've ever been.

644
00:41:04,539 --> 00:41:06,981
But I wanted it done
as soon as possible.

645
00:41:06,982 --> 00:41:10,437
I wasn't messing around with this stuff.

646
00:41:10,438 --> 00:41:14,920
As scared as dad was to come in the
house, he really wanted to help me.

647
00:41:14,921 --> 00:41:18,522
I was ready to fight these things.

648
00:41:18,523 --> 00:41:22,935
We had to go into the basement,
and we had to set up this...

649
00:41:22,936 --> 00:41:26,598
Holy water and black
salt protection barrier.

650
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:28,969
So, dad and I
stood back-to-back,

651
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:32,870
because I didn't want
anything to sneak up on us.

652
00:41:32,871 --> 00:41:35,188
When we went upstairs to do
the cleansing of the bedrooms,

653
00:41:35,189 --> 00:41:37,208
I felt a lot of resistance.

654
00:41:37,209 --> 00:41:40,571
Like, this thing was really
trying to fight us off.

655
00:41:40,572 --> 00:41:45,526
It was, like, the worst fear that
I've ever felt in that bedroom.

656
00:41:45,527 --> 00:41:47,400
After being attacked in that house,

657
00:41:47,401 --> 00:41:49,975
I felt Leah had every
right to be terrified.

658
00:41:49,976 --> 00:41:53,564
But the cleanse had to be done.

659
00:41:53,565 --> 00:41:56,995
When we were done, the
house was totally different.

660
00:41:56,996 --> 00:41:58,404
It felt really empty.

661
00:41:58,405 --> 00:42:02,913
Like, I was all alone,
but in a good way.

662
00:42:02,914 --> 00:42:05,269
Now that the house is
clean and everything's gone,

663
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:11,170
my family feels safe coming over, and
Rudy and I are ready to start a family.

664
00:42:11,903 --> 00:42:15,046
Any time a client is willing
to take immediate action,

665
00:42:15,047 --> 00:42:18,282
the impact can be extremely rewarding.

666
00:42:18,283 --> 00:42:19,974
With the support of her family,

667
00:42:19,975 --> 00:42:24,108
I'm confident Leah will continue
to keep her home free of evil.
