1
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:15,715
Tonight
on "Dead Files Revisited"...

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,883
It's freaking creepy.

3
00:00:16,918 --> 00:00:18,651
...a second look

4
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,389
at some of Amy and Steve's
most terrifying cases...

5
00:00:20,424 --> 00:00:21,856
What's with the face?

6
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:23,191
...new information...

7
00:00:23,226 --> 00:00:25,295
What Amy told me
completely shocked me.

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,365
...startling revelations.

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,868
I went straight for the priest.

10
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:30,234
First...

11
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,305
...a return
to Bloomington, Illinois...

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,605
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,744
...where an uncontrollable
psychopath...

14
00:00:35,779 --> 00:00:37,545
He's **** crazy.

15
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,916
...preys on a family.

16
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:41,653
Am I the target?

17
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:47,460
Then we travel
back to Seattle, Washington...

18
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:49,763
I'm experiencing
20 to 30 deaths.

19
00:00:49,798 --> 00:00:52,067
...where a scornful monster...

20
00:00:52,102 --> 00:00:53,567
I think she kills them.

21
00:00:53,602 --> 00:00:56,105
...puts lives in jeopardy.

22
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,226
And I don't want to die.

23
00:00:58,261 --> 00:00:59,903
Did they face their fears?

24
00:00:59,938 --> 00:01:01,511
What are you gonna do?

25
00:01:01,546 --> 00:01:03,682
Or is the nightmare continuing?

26
00:01:03,717 --> 00:01:05,985
I cast you out, Satan,

27
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,457
and all you demons
and your minions.

28
00:01:10,726 --> 00:01:12,846
They're being watched.

29
00:01:12,881 --> 00:01:14,966
My name is Amy Allan.

30
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,803
This thing likes death.

31
00:01:17,838 --> 00:01:19,436
I see dead people.

32
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:21,141
This thing's, like,
a monster.

33
00:01:21,176 --> 00:01:22,977
I speak to dead people.

34
00:01:23,012 --> 00:01:24,596
And he's pissed off now.

35
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:26,140
And they speak to me.

36
00:01:26,175 --> 00:01:27,649
His head was cracked.

37
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,221
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

38
00:01:31,256 --> 00:01:32,991
This guy was murdered.

39
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,410
I rely on my partner.

40
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:35,760
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

41
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,131
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

42
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,985
I cannot help you
unless I know the whole story.

43
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,804
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

44
00:01:43,805 --> 00:01:45,173
You saw her?

45
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,408
It's my job to reveal them.

46
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:47,409
Why would you
stay here?

47
00:01:47,444 --> 00:01:49,845
But Steve and I never speak...

48
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,916
We never communicate
during an investigation.

49
00:01:51,951 --> 00:01:53,570
...until the very end.

50
00:01:53,605 --> 00:01:55,154
Stop it.

51
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:57,124
We uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

52
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,243
I want to know the truth.

53
00:01:58,278 --> 00:01:59,327
I want to know
what's happening.

54
00:01:59,362 --> 00:02:00,794
Or time to get out.

55
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,133
I told you
there were ghosts in this house.

56
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:22,559
Nothing gets to me more
than a case involving kids.

57
00:02:22,594 --> 00:02:25,030
That's why our investigation
of a family home

58
00:02:25,065 --> 00:02:27,466
in Bloomington, Illinois,
was so intense.

59
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:29,620
Diane and Mark
had their share

60
00:02:29,655 --> 00:02:31,704
of strange,
unexplained activity,

61
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,759
but their son, Zack,
was getting the worst of it.

62
00:02:34,794 --> 00:02:37,780
After Amy and I figured out
what was really going on,

63
00:02:37,815 --> 00:02:40,484
it was clear we'd gotten there
just in time.

64
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:42,485
Okay, Diane.
So, what's going on?

65
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,925
Ever since we built the house
about eight years ago,

66
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,528
we've seen an apparition.

67
00:02:48,563 --> 00:02:51,232
He appeared to be,
like, a rancher,

68
00:02:51,267 --> 00:02:54,171
and it has begun
physically touching us.

69
00:02:54,206 --> 00:02:56,839
And that has me
really concerned

70
00:02:56,874 --> 00:03:00,912
because my son, Zack,
has muscular dystrophy.

71
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,614
Geez.
How old is he?

72
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:08,123
He's 15, and it's left him
using a wheelchair full-time.

73
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:09,625
Okay. Why are you
calling us in now?

74
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,724
What's the story?

75
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:14,364
It's gotten to the point
where he's having issues

76
00:03:14,365 --> 00:03:16,500
that doctors cannot explain.

77
00:03:16,535 --> 00:03:20,906
It was really hard living
with this for so many years.

78
00:03:20,907 --> 00:03:22,441
We didn't know

79
00:03:22,476 --> 00:03:26,383
if we were dealing with
something that was evil or dark.

80
00:03:26,418 --> 00:03:29,020
But after I had
some bad experiences

81
00:03:29,055 --> 00:03:30,819
of being physically injured,

82
00:03:30,854 --> 00:03:34,826
I became very frightened
for my son's safety.

83
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:36,595
That was really scary.

84
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,398
Do you think
it's something in the house

85
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:39,934
that may be causing
the problems?

86
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,138
I think it is.

87
00:03:55,423 --> 00:03:58,360
I saw this man with an axe.

88
00:03:59,995 --> 00:04:02,063
He smiles at me,
and I feel sick.

89
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:05,770
I ended up getting stalked
by that man the entire night.

90
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:08,271
This made my walk
extremely difficult

91
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:11,244
because he had an energy
I could barely stomach.

92
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:14,683
I'm seeing
the man with the axe.

93
00:04:16,284 --> 00:04:18,120
Can you describe him?

94
00:04:18,155 --> 00:04:19,855
He's pretty solid.

95
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:24,830
And usually, the solid ones
are more capable of interacting.

96
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:28,100
He's crazy.

97
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,721
Like, sociopathic.

98
00:04:30,756 --> 00:04:33,308
He was a murderer.

99
00:04:34,778 --> 00:04:36,344
Ever since we moved in,

100
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:38,514
anytime I've been down here,

101
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:41,719
I kind of catch something
on the corner of my eye.

102
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,308
It looks like a dark figure,
kind of short.

103
00:04:45,343 --> 00:04:48,896
Looks kind of like it has
maybe a hunchback.

104
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:51,165
Just goes by real quickly.

105
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,741
I knew deep down inside
that I had seen something.

106
00:04:56,776 --> 00:04:59,544
But I kept making excuses
for it, saying,

107
00:04:59,545 --> 00:05:03,016
"That's just my imagination.
I didn't really see anything."

108
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:07,757
I kept making that same excuse
for almost nine years.

109
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:12,463
I saw it
today when I was down here.

110
00:05:14,532 --> 00:05:16,635
It made me feel
really sick.

111
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,635
You okay? Yeah?

112
00:05:17,636 --> 00:05:19,938
Yeah.

113
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:23,646
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

114
00:05:26,783 --> 00:05:30,171
So, I see this doll thing.

115
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:33,560
It was over there,
and then it ran.

116
00:05:36,697 --> 00:05:38,683
It, like...

117
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:40,634
went in here.

118
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:46,277
And it's all black --
like, solid, solid black.

119
00:05:47,211 --> 00:05:49,413
The man with the axe

120
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:51,716
and the little doll thing
are related.

121
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,453
It was clear to me
that the man with the axe

122
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,974
could somehow control
the doll creature.

123
00:05:57,009 --> 00:05:59,495
Anytime one entity
can influence another,

124
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,649
that's a really bad sign.

125
00:06:01,684 --> 00:06:03,768
Is it dangerous at all?

126
00:06:03,803 --> 00:06:05,236
Yes.

127
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,378
After talking to
Diane's husband, Mark,

128
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:14,383
there's no question
the two of them needed our help.

129
00:06:14,418 --> 00:06:15,849
What do you think
is going on?

130
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,689
It just seems like everything's
revolving around Zack,

131
00:06:18,724 --> 00:06:19,721
and I'm concerned.

132
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:22,025
I mean, we don't know
what to do, really.

133
00:06:22,026 --> 00:06:25,898
And now I was about to find out
why they were so concerned.

134
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:27,468
I was about to meet their son.

135
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,465
So, what are you
experiencing?

136
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,417
One night,
I was laying in bed,

137
00:06:40,452 --> 00:06:44,523
and I saw these kids
playing on the floor.

138
00:06:44,558 --> 00:06:47,829
And then they looked up,
and they just vanished.

139
00:06:47,864 --> 00:06:48,728
Okay.

140
00:06:48,763 --> 00:06:50,633
What else
are you experiencing?

141
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:51,833
Well, one night,

142
00:06:51,868 --> 00:06:55,806
I heard someone
rummaging through the drawers

143
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:57,610
out in the kitchen.

144
00:06:57,645 --> 00:06:59,344
And I was so scared.

145
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:01,882
I thought
someone was in the house.

146
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:04,385
I did not feel safe
in my house,

147
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,919
but having Steve here

148
00:07:05,954 --> 00:07:09,627
made me a lot more comfortable
than what I was.

149
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:13,031
I kind of feel more secure
around him.

150
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,634
Are you having trouble
sleeping?

151
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:15,432
Yeah.

152
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:17,437
Are you hearing anything?

153
00:07:17,472 --> 00:07:18,836
Yeah, whispers --

154
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,190
like a female whisper.

155
00:07:21,225 --> 00:07:23,510
And what is she saying?

156
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:24,745
It's kind of mumbling.

157
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,149
Something like this,

158
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:28,784
like, really quiet.

159
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:32,592
Zack's life was
already challenging enough.

160
00:07:32,627 --> 00:07:34,795
I was hell-bent on helping him
and his family

161
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,964
figure out what was going on
in their house

162
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,400
and how to stop it.

163
00:07:41,904 --> 00:07:43,940
Like, I'm hearing
a child's laughter.

164
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:49,847
So, it's, like, this girl --

165
00:07:49,882 --> 00:07:54,255
she's developed
a twisted sense of humor.

166
00:07:55,758 --> 00:07:58,527
Do you have any idea what --
what she's doing?

167
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:00,830
She's messing with the people.

168
00:08:00,865 --> 00:08:02,632
I've seen this before.

169
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:05,537
Dead children don't always
understand that they're dead,

170
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:07,907
and the bad ones end up
tormenting the living.

171
00:08:07,908 --> 00:08:11,479
And what she does is,
like, crawling under the bed

172
00:08:11,514 --> 00:08:14,149
and doing bad things
under the bed,

173
00:08:14,184 --> 00:08:16,486
like coming up and out.

174
00:08:22,562 --> 00:08:24,729
It's freaking creepy.

175
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,864
Next...

176
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:27,800
It was a very tragic thing.

177
00:08:27,835 --> 00:08:31,106
...a sibling rivalry
ends in bloodshed.

178
00:08:31,141 --> 00:08:32,908
And I hear a gun go off.

179
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:34,776
Dead.

180
00:08:34,811 --> 00:08:37,147
And in our second
investigation...

181
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:38,514
I think she kills him.

182
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,885
...life hangs by a thread.

183
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,789
I thought I was gonna die.

184
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:54,005
Diane's house
in Bloomington, Illinois,

185
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,204
was fairly new,

186
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:57,042
and nothing about it
gave me any clues

187
00:08:57,077 --> 00:08:58,810
to what was really
happening there.

188
00:08:58,845 --> 00:09:00,947
But after all this time
working with Amy,

189
00:09:00,982 --> 00:09:03,050
I know the house
isn't always the problem.

190
00:09:03,051 --> 00:09:05,321
And it was a local historian
who helped me prove

191
00:09:05,356 --> 00:09:06,755
Diane and her family

192
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,260
weren't the first people
to suffer on that property.

193
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:15,834
The house
I'm investigating --

194
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:18,171
I was wondering
if you could help me out

195
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:20,507
and tell me what was there
before that.

196
00:09:20,508 --> 00:09:25,115
It was a farm,
over 300 acres at one time,

197
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,185
owned by William King
in 1836.

198
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,920
How's life for them?

199
00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:32,492
They had
a great many challenges here.

200
00:09:32,527 --> 00:09:34,393
At the age of 29,

201
00:09:34,428 --> 00:09:38,217
his first wife, Amelia,
died in childbirth,

202
00:09:38,252 --> 00:09:41,330
and two of his boys died
when they were young.

203
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:44,409
What can you tell me
about William King himself?

204
00:09:44,444 --> 00:09:45,608
What kind of guy was he?

205
00:09:45,643 --> 00:09:48,647
He was a remarkably tough
individual.

206
00:09:48,682 --> 00:09:49,781
Okay.

207
00:09:49,816 --> 00:09:53,254
But he died on the farm
at the age of 41 years.

208
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:56,225
It was a very tragic thing.

209
00:09:59,596 --> 00:10:02,999
The man with the axe --

210
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:05,471
like, I don't even know
where this guy came from.

211
00:10:05,506 --> 00:10:07,992
Do you have any idea
why he's here?

212
00:10:08,027 --> 00:10:10,478
I see him, like,
working on the land.

213
00:10:10,513 --> 00:10:13,114
Like, maybe he owned it.

214
00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:14,583
Okay.

215
00:10:14,618 --> 00:10:17,355
When the dead don't want me
to know their story,

216
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,723
they'll sometimes alter
their appearance.

217
00:10:19,758 --> 00:10:22,895
This makes it tougher for me
to see what's really going on,

218
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,366
and the man with the axe
was no exception.

219
00:10:25,401 --> 00:10:27,501
The weird thing is

220
00:10:27,536 --> 00:10:30,606
now he's wearing a suit,
pants -- nice pants --

221
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:33,442
like he's wealthy.

222
00:10:33,477 --> 00:10:36,948
And he's probably,
like, in his 40s.

223
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,652
I was on a mission

224
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:42,721
to help a teenage kid
and his family

225
00:10:42,756 --> 00:10:45,360
figure out what was actually
happening in their house.

226
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,964
And now that I knew one
of the previous landowner's sons

227
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:50,367
had died mysteriously
at a young age,

228
00:10:50,402 --> 00:10:51,935
I needed to find out more.

229
00:10:58,678 --> 00:11:01,548
George was kind of
a wild kid.

230
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,036
He'd been a partyer,
a drinker.

231
00:11:04,071 --> 00:11:08,457
- Now, did George ever run the farm
or take over at any point? - No.

232
00:11:08,492 --> 00:11:11,964
The farm went to his younger
brother, Zephaniah,

233
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,964
not George.

234
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:14,800
Which is not common, right?

235
00:11:14,835 --> 00:11:16,337
No.

236
00:11:21,044 --> 00:11:23,747
There's these two men,
and they're yelling.

237
00:11:23,782 --> 00:11:24,681
They're yelling.

238
00:11:27,151 --> 00:11:30,857
This one guy really, really
wants to see the other one dead

239
00:11:30,892 --> 00:11:35,329
because he's preventing him
from having what he wants.

240
00:11:35,364 --> 00:11:37,598
I think it's a land thing.

241
00:11:39,536 --> 00:11:42,339
Ordinarily, it would've gone
to the oldest son

242
00:11:42,374 --> 00:11:44,475
that was available
to run the farm.

243
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,145
But George was unreliable,

244
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,181
and the family couldn't
turn it over to somebody
they couldn't trust.

245
00:11:49,182 --> 00:11:51,718
Okay.

246
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,656
Do you get any names on them?

247
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:58,061
I get a George.

248
00:11:59,463 --> 00:12:01,900
But people don't like him
because, you know,

249
00:12:01,935 --> 00:12:03,403
he's **** crazy.

250
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,306
Now, I heard that George died
kind of mysteriously.

251
00:12:07,307 --> 00:12:08,944
Do you know
anything about that?

252
00:12:10,945 --> 00:12:14,484
Apparently, George was
over at the house for dinner.

253
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,023
He took a nap on the couch,
and a gunshot was heard.

254
00:12:19,925 --> 00:12:24,415
He's, like,
in this little house.

255
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,905
And there's a table,
like, to eat at.

256
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:33,845
And I see him,
like, in darkness.

257
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:39,053
And I hear the sound
of a gun go off.

258
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:42,057
Dead.

259
00:12:50,234 --> 00:12:53,271
I had seen a lot of threatening
entities in that home,

260
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,174
especially
the man with the axe.

261
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:56,608
But what concerned me more

262
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,679
was how vulnerable
the living were

263
00:12:58,714 --> 00:13:00,246
when they were sleeping.

264
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:04,319
There's one person
in the bed,

265
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,024
kind of
in the middle of it.

266
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:12,964
This kind of sheet
of, like, gray mist

267
00:13:12,965 --> 00:13:15,303
is coming out
from under the bed.

268
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,044
Is this what you saw?

269
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,248
Yes.

270
00:13:25,283 --> 00:13:26,485
Up next...

271
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,652
Am I the target?

272
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:30,555
I think
everyone in the house is.

273
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,958
What happened
after the investigation?

274
00:13:32,993 --> 00:13:38,068
But I will do anything to make
sure my son is protected.

275
00:13:38,103 --> 00:13:40,638
All spirits in this house,
I command thee,

276
00:13:40,673 --> 00:13:42,774
come to the light,
come to the gate.

277
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:08,610
Mark, Diane, I want you
to meet my partner, Amy.

278
00:14:08,645 --> 00:14:12,581
They have a son, Zack,
who is confined to a wheelchair.

279
00:14:12,616 --> 00:14:14,618
And from the minute
they moved in,

280
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,586
they've been
experiencing things.

281
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:19,925
The night of the reveal,
we were really anxious.

282
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,694
We were really concerned
that Amy might say,

283
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,130
"Look, it's not safe."

284
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:27,367
We have this home
specifically built for our son

285
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:29,638
so that it
would all be accessible,

286
00:14:29,673 --> 00:14:32,309
and it would be really,
really difficult

287
00:14:32,344 --> 00:14:34,196
to try to start that over.

288
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:36,013
Down here in the basement,

289
00:14:36,048 --> 00:14:39,520
I actually witnessed
a huge fistfight.

290
00:14:39,555 --> 00:14:42,423
There was a male
named George.

291
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,026
He was in his 20s.

292
00:14:44,061 --> 00:14:45,594
And I heard a gunshot.

293
00:14:45,595 --> 00:14:49,498
And I think George...
was killed.

294
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:51,586
I got to tell you something.

295
00:14:51,621 --> 00:14:53,640
This is the most amazing thing
I've heard

296
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:55,774
as far as, like, nailing it.

297
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:58,914
William King, who settled here,
had a son named George.

298
00:14:59,914 --> 00:15:02,450
George was
the oldest available son

299
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:05,188
that should've been
taking over the farm.

300
00:15:05,223 --> 00:15:06,623
But he didn't get it.

301
00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:08,760
It went, actually,
to his younger brother.

302
00:15:08,795 --> 00:15:11,582
Now, George came here
to the farm,

303
00:15:11,617 --> 00:15:14,369
and he accidentally
shot himself.

304
00:15:17,505 --> 00:15:19,641
So, what else did you see?

305
00:15:19,642 --> 00:15:24,213
I encountered a male
who had an axe.

306
00:15:24,248 --> 00:15:27,252
The bad thing about him
is that he's absolutely crazy.

307
00:15:27,287 --> 00:15:29,621
I would say
he's a sociopath.

308
00:15:29,656 --> 00:15:32,358
And he's able to manipulate
his surroundings.

309
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:35,113
The next thing
that I ran into

310
00:15:35,148 --> 00:15:37,867
was this weird
little doll.

311
00:15:37,902 --> 00:15:39,735
It's all dark.

312
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,137
It's, like,
made of darkness.

313
00:15:41,172 --> 00:15:44,476
It's this little thing
that the axe man created

314
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:46,044
that can do his bidding...

315
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,483
to, like, torture
and drive you nuts.

316
00:15:49,484 --> 00:15:51,837
That was frightening,

317
00:15:51,872 --> 00:15:54,155
but it was good
finding out

318
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:57,962
that there was something
going on in the basement.

319
00:15:57,997 --> 00:16:01,098
It explained my dread
of going down there,

320
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:05,055
that it wasn't my imagination,
that I wasn't crazy.

321
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:08,977
This guy William King,
who settled here in 1836--

322
00:16:09,012 --> 00:16:11,012
he lost two sons.

323
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:12,814
They died on the property.

324
00:16:12,849 --> 00:16:15,553
Does that make
any sense to you?

325
00:16:15,588 --> 00:16:18,222
I did get two children
in the house.

326
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:23,631
I have sensed for years
that there is a child.

327
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:27,637
I could hear
the little footsteps

328
00:16:27,672 --> 00:16:30,505
come by me, next to me,

329
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,027
when I was getting ready
to go to bed.

330
00:16:33,062 --> 00:16:35,723
Yeah, the girl here
is very active.

331
00:16:35,758 --> 00:16:38,440
She likes to hide
under the beds.

332
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:41,122
This is her form
of entertainment.

333
00:16:41,157 --> 00:16:42,790
What about this?

334
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,496
That actually
could be your son.

335
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:51,403
There's something called
spontaneous psychokinesis.

336
00:16:51,438 --> 00:16:53,871
So, with any ability,

337
00:16:53,906 --> 00:16:57,243
you're going to have
experiences like this.

338
00:16:57,244 --> 00:16:59,180
How old is your son?

339
00:16:59,215 --> 00:17:00,382
15.

340
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:01,782
It can be hormonal.

341
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:06,223
Usually, it's around children
who are teenagers.

342
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,560
Does Diane's son
have abilities?

343
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:11,714
Probably, yeah.

344
00:17:11,749 --> 00:17:13,801
Because Diane does.

345
00:17:15,137 --> 00:17:18,474
What Amy told me about Zack
completely shocked me.

346
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:21,044
I didn't want to accept
the concept

347
00:17:21,045 --> 00:17:23,948
that Zack could cause
physical things to happen

348
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:26,919
without even
physically doing anything.

349
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:29,856
I really didn't know
how to take it.

350
00:17:29,891 --> 00:17:32,893
I did do a sketch
of what I saw

351
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:36,133
in the master bedroom
with the girl.

352
00:17:39,737 --> 00:17:41,539
That's usually
where I sleep.

353
00:17:41,574 --> 00:17:43,508
Am I the target?

354
00:17:43,543 --> 00:17:45,879
I think everyone
in the house is.

355
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,287
The most terrifying part
of this whole thing

356
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:53,855
was this little girl.

357
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,928
I didn't know
if she wanted to hurt us

358
00:17:56,963 --> 00:17:59,697
or get rid of one of us
or what.

359
00:17:59,732 --> 00:18:03,003
It was really hard
sleeping in my room again.

360
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:04,303
It felt invaded.

361
00:18:04,338 --> 00:18:06,190
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy

362
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:08,043
and see if she has
some answers for you.

363
00:18:08,078 --> 00:18:11,313
You need to have
a medium come in,

364
00:18:11,348 --> 00:18:14,786
and she's gonna have to get
this little girl out of here.

365
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:17,054
We also do a cleansing
around the property

366
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:24,198
to set up a boundary
against the man with the axe

367
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:27,905
and other various dead
who might wander through.

368
00:18:29,473 --> 00:18:30,773
My question to you now is,

369
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:32,578
are you gonna follow
Amy's advice?

370
00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:50,134
After the reveal,

371
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:54,241
I felt like it was
my responsibility as a mother

372
00:18:54,276 --> 00:18:56,612
to take Amy's advice to heart.

373
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:03,086
Anyone who knows me will know
that I will do anything

374
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:06,424
to make sure my son
is protected.

375
00:19:06,459 --> 00:19:08,860
And I don't just give up.

376
00:19:11,331 --> 00:19:13,466
When the medium came in,

377
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:16,672
it was really intense
at the house.

378
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,078
It was really scary.

379
00:19:21,813 --> 00:19:24,818
All spirits in this house,
I command thee,

380
00:19:24,853 --> 00:19:26,653
come to the light,
come to the gate.

381
00:19:28,522 --> 00:19:29,622
Come to the gate.

382
00:19:29,657 --> 00:19:31,193
Go through to the source.

383
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:38,202
You could just sense how many
ghosts or spirits there were.

384
00:19:38,237 --> 00:19:43,376
So that the entities in this
house may go through the gate

385
00:19:43,411 --> 00:19:46,648
and find the light
so they may find their freedom.

386
00:19:49,752 --> 00:19:52,655
Once the entities
had crossed over,

387
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,559
we felt like this
was our home finally.

388
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,395
We felt like we owned it.

389
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,831
We felt like we belonged here.

390
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:04,504
The whole air felt
a lot lighter, felt like --

391
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:10,180
like a weight's been lifted off,
and so it's a lot better now.

392
00:20:10,215 --> 00:20:13,919
We want to make
the most of Zack's life

393
00:20:13,954 --> 00:20:16,921
because he has
this serious illness,

394
00:20:16,956 --> 00:20:20,460
and it's really important
for him to feel safe.

395
00:20:20,495 --> 00:20:24,299
It makes me a lot happier
having my mom not worry

396
00:20:24,334 --> 00:20:27,470
about different spirits
bothering her at night

397
00:20:27,505 --> 00:20:29,506
or worrying about me.

398
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:34,181
After coming into contact
with the spirit world,

399
00:20:34,216 --> 00:20:38,118
I feel more accepting
of Zack's illness

400
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:42,960
because it helped me
deal with the grieving process

401
00:20:42,995 --> 00:20:46,364
and that you need to let go.

402
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:48,766
He needs every moment,

403
00:20:48,801 --> 00:20:52,204
and he needs his moments
to be happy.

404
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:55,577
It's clear
that this entire experience

405
00:20:55,612 --> 00:20:58,880
has been challenging
for Diane and her family,

406
00:20:58,915 --> 00:21:01,551
but I'm hopeful that their
efforts to cleanse the home

407
00:21:01,586 --> 00:21:04,188
will make their time
in that house peaceful and safe.

408
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:20,010
Amy and I have investigated
our share of restaurants,

409
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,514
but the Merchants Cafe
in Seattle, Washington,

410
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:24,649
left an unforgettable
impression.

411
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:27,555
The activity had sent business
into a nose dive,

412
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,742
and the owner's help
was going with it.

413
00:21:29,777 --> 00:21:31,860
And by the end
of our investigation,

414
00:21:31,895 --> 00:21:34,732
it was clear that the problems
there were even more severe.

415
00:21:37,636 --> 00:21:39,303
Hey, Darcy.

416
00:21:39,338 --> 00:21:40,905
What's going on?

417
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,443
I just got this business
a year and a half ago,

418
00:21:43,478 --> 00:21:45,096
and I've had guests
that believe

419
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:46,790
they've been pushed
down the stairs,

420
00:21:46,825 --> 00:21:48,449
guests that have seen
apparitions.

421
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,969
I've seen apparitions.

422
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:51,488
I could go on and on.

423
00:21:51,489 --> 00:21:52,621
Okay.

424
00:21:52,656 --> 00:21:53,857
And this
is affecting business?

425
00:21:53,892 --> 00:21:55,158
It is.

426
00:21:55,193 --> 00:21:57,463
People come in here
all the time and say,

427
00:21:57,498 --> 00:21:58,899
"Why are you still here?

428
00:21:58,934 --> 00:22:00,300
Why don't you just get out?"

429
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:01,968
And it's not an option.

430
00:22:02,003 --> 00:22:04,872
How about previous owners?
You ever talk to them?

431
00:22:04,873 --> 00:22:06,207
The only thing
I really know

432
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:09,963
is there were seven owners
in the last eight years.

433
00:22:09,998 --> 00:22:13,685
And I can't afford to be
the eighth in nine years.

434
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,921
I can't do it.

435
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,281
There's, like, too many people.

436
00:22:40,723 --> 00:22:42,524
What's going on?

437
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,364
I'm experiencing
about 20 to 30 deaths.

438
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:50,135
And it's wreaking havoc
on my body.

439
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,574
From the moment
I entered that building,

440
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:54,440
the dead completely
overwhelmed me,

441
00:22:54,475 --> 00:22:57,279
and with that many people
fighting for my attention,

442
00:22:57,314 --> 00:22:59,299
the only thing
I could think was,

443
00:22:59,334 --> 00:23:01,285
"Will I be able
to help them all?"

444
00:23:03,422 --> 00:23:06,192
I have all these lives
going through my mind.

445
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,666
There is some crazy ****

446
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:13,536
Some of his face is missing.

447
00:23:13,571 --> 00:23:14,702
Next...

448
00:23:14,737 --> 00:23:17,407
All the wine
thrown across the floor.

449
00:23:17,442 --> 00:23:20,043
...evil runs rampant.

450
00:23:20,044 --> 00:23:22,481
Get bad people in a bad place,

451
00:23:22,516 --> 00:23:24,918
bad things are gonna happen.

452
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:38,705
The Merchants Cafe in Seattle

453
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,608
had been around
for over 100 years,

454
00:23:40,643 --> 00:23:42,394
yet it couldn't hang on
to an owner

455
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:44,110
for more
than a year at a time.

456
00:23:44,145 --> 00:23:47,032
But as soon as the current owner
started showing me around,

457
00:23:47,067 --> 00:23:49,920
it made sense why the turnover
at the property was so high.

458
00:23:49,955 --> 00:23:53,392
Darcy, why'd you bring me
to this spot?

459
00:23:53,427 --> 00:23:56,563
One night at closing,
my manager was here,

460
00:23:56,598 --> 00:23:59,700
and we were arguing,
and it just got misty.

461
00:23:59,735 --> 00:24:01,336
Like a fog?

462
00:24:01,371 --> 00:24:02,937
Like fog.

463
00:24:02,938 --> 00:24:05,024
There were so many times

464
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:07,110
where I ran out
of this restaurant

465
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,411
over different events

466
00:24:08,412 --> 00:24:11,616
and to the point where
I could not even bring myself

467
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:13,286
to walk back in the door.

468
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:14,886
See anything else up here?

469
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:17,156
One night, I closed up,
and the next morning,

470
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:20,729
all the wine was literally
thrown from this wine rack

471
00:24:20,764 --> 00:24:23,634
all the way across the floor
and broken.

472
00:24:25,302 --> 00:24:26,937
And this was intact?

473
00:24:26,938 --> 00:24:28,874
This didn't fall down
or anything?

474
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:30,243
No, it did not.

475
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,730
There's a guy here.

476
00:24:44,765 --> 00:24:47,031
He looks real bad.

477
00:24:47,066 --> 00:24:49,735
Some of his face is missing.

478
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:53,607
He doesn't like
to be interfered with.

479
00:24:53,642 --> 00:24:55,409
At that point,
I couldn't tell

480
00:24:55,444 --> 00:24:58,081
how that man had gotten
into such rough shape.

481
00:24:58,116 --> 00:25:00,883
But one thing was certain --

482
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:05,173
his uncontrollable temper
led to many violent outbursts.

483
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:09,429
I feel like if he's being
in a particularly angry mood,

484
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,699
you'd feel him.

485
00:25:11,734 --> 00:25:15,004
And he moves a lot of things
all the time.

486
00:25:15,005 --> 00:25:16,840
Like what?

487
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:20,062
I don't know --
just stuff around the bar.

488
00:25:20,097 --> 00:25:23,250
It's weird 'cause he doesn't
want to be here.

489
00:25:23,285 --> 00:25:26,688
This isn't --
isn't working for him.

490
00:25:28,323 --> 00:25:30,792
I've had
a number of customers

491
00:25:30,827 --> 00:25:33,798
that say that they see a woman
go into the bathroom

492
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:34,931
and shut the door.

493
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,533
So they'll wait and wait,

494
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:40,139
and then, finally, they go in,
and there's nobody there.

495
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:44,078
A lot of them will just
ask for their check and leave.

496
00:25:44,113 --> 00:25:46,782
I've set up
a really comfortable,

497
00:25:46,817 --> 00:25:48,550
homey environment here,

498
00:25:48,585 --> 00:25:52,491
and that's not really
what my guests are feeling.

499
00:25:52,526 --> 00:25:54,158
Instead, people would leave,

500
00:25:54,193 --> 00:25:56,861
and they would
probably not come back.

501
00:25:56,896 --> 00:25:59,733
You're having trouble
keeping customers, obviously.

502
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:01,269
I mean, how are you
dealing with all this?

503
00:26:01,304 --> 00:26:02,770
Not well.

504
00:26:02,805 --> 00:26:07,010
I actually was in the hospital
for five days in a row.

505
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:11,216
They can't figure out
how I got that sick that fast

506
00:26:11,217 --> 00:26:12,216
when I'm healthy.

507
00:26:12,251 --> 00:26:13,852
How serious did it get?

508
00:26:13,887 --> 00:26:16,290
You know, I didn't
even actually know

509
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,860
if I was gonna live
through it.

510
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:24,869
There's this religious woman.

511
00:26:27,205 --> 00:26:30,310
I think that living people,
they see<i> her.</i>

512
00:26:30,345 --> 00:26:34,081
She's, scary.

513
00:26:36,251 --> 00:26:39,389
She, like, picks people.

514
00:26:39,424 --> 00:26:41,658
What do you mean?

515
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:45,363
She picks the weak, women...

516
00:26:45,431 --> 00:26:49,101
sickly people.

517
00:26:49,136 --> 00:26:51,104
From the moment
I saw that woman,

518
00:26:51,139 --> 00:26:53,842
I knew I was looking
right into the eyes of evil.

519
00:26:53,843 --> 00:26:57,145
And what she wanted to do
to the living

520
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,651
had me concerned
for the people who worked there.

521
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:01,418
What does she do?

522
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,490
I think she **** kills them.

523
00:27:04,525 --> 00:27:07,128
How does she do that?

524
00:27:07,163 --> 00:27:09,063
It's a touch.

525
00:27:10,565 --> 00:27:11,867
They **** die.

526
00:27:13,436 --> 00:27:16,908
With all the activity happening
in the restaurant,

527
00:27:16,943 --> 00:27:20,111
Darcy couldn't pay her employees
enough to stick around.

528
00:27:20,112 --> 00:27:21,980
So before she lost
another one,

529
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,619
I decided to help her bartender
face his fears.

530
00:27:30,894 --> 00:27:33,799
So, Matt, how long
have you been working here?

531
00:27:33,834 --> 00:27:35,799
- About a year and a half now.
- Okay.

532
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:38,003
This is my first time down here
in over a year.

533
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:39,505
What have you experienced?

534
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,908
I'd come down here
with a glass

535
00:27:41,943 --> 00:27:44,780
very similar to the one
that's right here on the bar.

536
00:27:44,815 --> 00:27:46,481
I'd put the glass down.

537
00:27:46,516 --> 00:27:49,154
I made my way around
the back side of the bar here.

538
00:27:49,189 --> 00:27:51,590
When I came back,
I reached for my glass,

539
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:53,156
and it had slid about 4 feet,

540
00:27:53,191 --> 00:27:57,598
and all I saw was it hitting
the lip and going over the edge.

541
00:27:57,633 --> 00:27:59,600
Hearing the actual smash --

542
00:27:59,635 --> 00:28:02,271
I mean, that sound is something
that I'm not gonna forget

543
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:03,639
for a long time.

544
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,309
Now, if I walked away
and left you here,

545
00:28:06,344 --> 00:28:08,178
would you be freaking out?

546
00:28:08,213 --> 00:28:10,416
And it just took
that one incident for you?

547
00:28:10,451 --> 00:28:12,336
That's all it took.

548
00:28:12,371 --> 00:28:14,186
- It made me a believer.
- Next...

549
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:16,123
They're all burned.

550
00:28:16,158 --> 00:28:18,026
They're all nasty.
It's bad.

551
00:28:18,027 --> 00:28:20,697
...the dead
rise against the living.

552
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:23,033
They're bent on revenge.

553
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:26,087
And what happened
after the investigation?

554
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:29,141
The woman downstairs
is trying to kill me.

555
00:28:29,176 --> 00:28:31,245
Something really
had to be done.

556
00:28:42,494 --> 00:28:45,398
It sounded like
the paranormal activity

557
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:47,651
in Merchants Cafe
was out of control.

558
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:49,870
But broken glassware
and a creepy fog

559
00:28:49,871 --> 00:28:51,738
didn't give me much to go on.

560
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:53,708
So, I had to start
with my only lead --

561
00:28:53,743 --> 00:28:56,781
the fire that destroyed
the building in the late 1800s.

562
00:29:04,024 --> 00:29:09,063
The two-story wooden structure
that originally was on that site

563
00:29:09,064 --> 00:29:12,885
was burned during the great
Seattle fire of June 6, 1889.

564
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,707
This is a picture taken of
the aftermath of the fire.

565
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:19,378
Now, did anybody die
in this fire?

566
00:29:19,413 --> 00:29:20,746
Yes.

567
00:29:20,747 --> 00:29:23,251
A young boy
died in the fire,

568
00:29:23,286 --> 00:29:24,550
and one wall came down

569
00:29:24,585 --> 00:29:26,153
and ended up killing
a gentleman.

570
00:29:26,188 --> 00:29:30,260
Were there any other fires
in or around the Merchants Cafe?

571
00:29:30,295 --> 00:29:34,517
The only other one that
I know of took place in 1885.

572
00:29:34,552 --> 00:29:38,739
It was a huge fire where
two people did lose their life.

573
00:29:38,774 --> 00:29:39,774
Okay.

574
00:29:42,344 --> 00:29:45,079
Before this building was here,

575
00:29:45,114 --> 00:29:48,419
there was another structure here
that was smaller.

576
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:51,055
I think it burned down
a few times.

577
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:54,526
I'm experiencing
a lot of other people's deaths.

578
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:55,393
How many?

579
00:29:55,428 --> 00:29:57,030
Probably about 20 or 30.

580
00:29:57,065 --> 00:29:58,984
They died in a fire.

581
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:00,868
They're all burned.

582
00:30:00,903 --> 00:30:02,870
They're all nasty.
It's bad.

583
00:30:02,905 --> 00:30:05,108
In a location
where an unexpected,

584
00:30:05,143 --> 00:30:06,676
tragic event has happened,

585
00:30:06,711 --> 00:30:09,982
it's common for me to see
many lost and confused souls.

586
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:12,417
But that wasn't the case
in that basement.

587
00:30:12,452 --> 00:30:17,626
Instead, the dead had united
and were out for blood.

588
00:30:17,661 --> 00:30:22,800
They're very bent on revenge
for what happened to them.

589
00:30:22,835 --> 00:30:25,736
They'll go after that person.

590
00:30:25,737 --> 00:30:29,176
After the great Seattle fire,
the new owners had big plans

591
00:30:29,211 --> 00:30:31,296
for the future
of the Merchants Cafe.

592
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:33,346
But according to
a local historian,

593
00:30:33,381 --> 00:30:36,553
that location was about to spend
the next 100 years

594
00:30:36,588 --> 00:30:38,890
plagued by tragedy.

595
00:30:45,131 --> 00:30:48,018
One of the first owners
was a man named John Osner,

596
00:30:48,053 --> 00:30:50,905
who opened the Merchants
Exchange Saloon in the basement.

597
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,110
In 1893, Osner
got desperate for revenue

598
00:30:54,111 --> 00:30:56,013
and decided that he would take
the basement

599
00:30:56,048 --> 00:30:58,381
and turn it
into an illegal card room,

600
00:30:58,416 --> 00:31:01,721
and then the upstairs hotel
became a brothel.

601
00:31:01,756 --> 00:31:03,257
Okay. So, he had
a gambling parlor.

602
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:04,759
He had the bar
and the brothel.

603
00:31:04,794 --> 00:31:06,194
That's right.

604
00:31:11,101 --> 00:31:13,271
There were people,
lots and lots of people,

605
00:31:13,306 --> 00:31:14,873
laughing and having
a good time,

606
00:31:14,908 --> 00:31:17,842
and there were prostitutes

607
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:20,647
but dressed nice,
like, old-fashioned.

608
00:31:20,682 --> 00:31:23,217
Any idea when?

609
00:31:23,218 --> 00:31:24,418
1880s?

610
00:31:24,453 --> 00:31:27,524
There was
really friggin' bad people.

611
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:30,195
Get bad people in a bad place,

612
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,831
bad things are gonna happen.

613
00:31:34,368 --> 00:31:37,871
I had a lot of facts
but nothing I could really tie

614
00:31:37,872 --> 00:31:39,991
to what Darcy
and the staff had seen.

615
00:31:40,026 --> 00:31:42,603
But all of that
was about to change.

616
00:31:42,638 --> 00:31:45,146
So, did Osner run it
the entire time?

617
00:31:45,181 --> 00:31:48,953
No. In 1898, they sold
a big portion of the business

618
00:31:48,988 --> 00:31:51,456
to a fellow
named F.X. Schreiner.

619
00:31:51,491 --> 00:31:54,762
Schreiner's wife, Mary,
was not approving.

620
00:31:54,797 --> 00:31:56,696
She was a very devout woman.

621
00:31:56,731 --> 00:31:59,885
She died of consumption,
or what we call "tuberculosis."

622
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,040
He was broken and went back
to Germany for a period of time.

623
00:32:03,075 --> 00:32:04,841
What happened
to the business?

624
00:32:04,876 --> 00:32:08,047
The other partners
brought in a new bartender

625
00:32:08,082 --> 00:32:10,084
by the name of Otto Hink.

626
00:32:11,852 --> 00:32:14,154
Was he a body builder
or something?

627
00:32:14,189 --> 00:32:17,727
He was a wrestler, actually,
and he became the barkeeper.

628
00:32:17,762 --> 00:32:20,465
He had a wife and children
in town,

629
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,998
but he also had a habit

630
00:32:22,033 --> 00:32:24,535
of frequenting
the brothels himself.

631
00:32:24,536 --> 00:32:27,440
And so the party, for him,
was over at age 42

632
00:32:27,475 --> 00:32:29,910
because he had already
contracted

633
00:32:29,945 --> 00:32:31,578
syphilis of the brain.

634
00:32:31,613 --> 00:32:33,466
And he began to have
dementia.

635
00:32:33,501 --> 00:32:35,284
He ended up being committed

636
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:38,990
and lived in sanitariums
for the rest of his life.

637
00:32:43,397 --> 00:32:45,733
He's very, very,
very physical.

638
00:32:45,768 --> 00:32:47,200
Like, I see iron fists --

639
00:32:47,235 --> 00:32:50,171
like, ran this place
with, like, an iron fist.

640
00:32:50,172 --> 00:32:53,744
He's, like, a pretty buff guy.

641
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:56,179
Like, he fought a lot.

642
00:32:56,214 --> 00:32:59,418
Based off my first impressions,
I felt that man was evil.

643
00:32:59,453 --> 00:33:00,619
The injury on his face alone

644
00:33:00,654 --> 00:33:03,492
suggested he'd have no problem
hurting me.

645
00:33:03,527 --> 00:33:05,879
But I'll admit,
in my line of work,

646
00:33:05,914 --> 00:33:08,491
things aren't always
what they seem.

647
00:33:08,526 --> 00:33:11,265
Something about a child
or children,

648
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,004
and he wants to
take care of them

649
00:33:14,005 --> 00:33:15,941
but can't and doesn't.

650
00:33:15,976 --> 00:33:19,814
He's angry, confused, hurt.

651
00:33:19,849 --> 00:33:21,949
And he...

652
00:33:21,984 --> 00:33:25,187
doesn't understand
what's happening.

653
00:33:25,188 --> 00:33:26,556
Coming up next...

654
00:33:26,591 --> 00:33:29,192
I was a mess -- a mess.

655
00:33:29,227 --> 00:33:31,596
...Amy exposes
the shocking truth.

656
00:33:31,631 --> 00:33:33,264
- Now, what kind of a risk are we
talking about? - She'd kill her.

657
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:36,002
And the story...

658
00:33:36,037 --> 00:33:37,336
I went
straight for the priest.

659
00:33:37,371 --> 00:33:39,973
...comes to
a terrifying conclusion.

660
00:33:40,008 --> 00:33:43,848
I cast you out, Satan,
and all your minions.

661
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:08,514
Darcy bought this place

662
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:10,049
about a year and a half ago.

663
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:14,690
She never believed
in the paranormal at all.

664
00:34:14,725 --> 00:34:16,843
Then she started working here.

665
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:18,962
Going into the reveal,

666
00:34:18,963 --> 00:34:22,083
I actually really wanted to know
what Amy found

667
00:34:22,118 --> 00:34:25,204
and if Amy was gonna say
it was safe to stay here.

668
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,671
Matt works here.

669
00:34:26,706 --> 00:34:28,275
Matt's so afraid
to go downstairs,

670
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,443
he's losing shifts.

671
00:34:29,478 --> 00:34:32,380
So, with that,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

672
00:34:32,415 --> 00:34:37,822
I felt like this was
a really bad area at one time,

673
00:34:37,857 --> 00:34:43,230
but I got in here parties
and dancing and prostitutes.

674
00:34:43,265 --> 00:34:46,233
What time period
are you talking about?

675
00:34:46,268 --> 00:34:47,570
It was like the 1880s.

676
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:51,139
During my research,

677
00:34:51,174 --> 00:34:54,011
I came across a guy
by the name of F.X. Schreiner,

678
00:34:54,046 --> 00:34:56,065
who owned the place.

679
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,049
Up here was the booze.

680
00:34:58,084 --> 00:34:59,551
And then there was
a brothel upstairs.

681
00:34:59,552 --> 00:35:01,120
Interesting.

682
00:35:01,155 --> 00:35:03,892
What else did you wind up seeing
on your walk?

683
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:05,393
I was up here,

684
00:35:05,428 --> 00:35:08,798
and I met a guy
behind the bar,

685
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:11,602
and he was very forceful.

686
00:35:11,637 --> 00:35:14,372
He probably ran this place

687
00:35:14,373 --> 00:35:17,676
and ran it
with, like, an iron fist,

688
00:35:17,711 --> 00:35:21,065
but he's very confused
about what's happening.

689
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,420
Let me tell you about a guy
named Otto Hink.

690
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,959
When the wife
of F.X. Schreiner died,

691
00:35:27,994 --> 00:35:31,464
Otto Hink took over
running the place.

692
00:35:31,499 --> 00:35:33,700
He was a wrestler --
strong guy.

693
00:35:33,735 --> 00:35:34,800
He was the bar guy.

694
00:35:34,835 --> 00:35:37,372
You said he was confused,
right?

695
00:35:37,407 --> 00:35:38,572
Yeah.

696
00:35:38,607 --> 00:35:42,245
Okay. He liked to visit
the brothel himself.

697
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,883
Apparently, he contracted
syphilis of the brain.

698
00:35:45,918 --> 00:35:47,986
So at a young age, 42,

699
00:35:47,987 --> 00:35:51,123
he started going
a little mental.

700
00:35:51,158 --> 00:35:54,961
He's very, very territorial,
especially back there.

701
00:35:54,996 --> 00:35:59,069
And if you get in his way,
he can push you out of the way.

702
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:02,540
I wasn't surprised
about Otto Hink.

703
00:36:02,575 --> 00:36:04,108
I hadn't seen him,

704
00:36:04,143 --> 00:36:08,048
but the staff have seen him,
and guests, as well.

705
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:11,086
But, you know,
he's just trying to work.

706
00:36:11,121 --> 00:36:14,054
It's his job, loves his job,
trying to work.

707
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:18,028
You think the guy
you saw is Otto Hink?

708
00:36:18,063 --> 00:36:19,296
I think it's very likely.

709
00:36:19,297 --> 00:36:22,451
I did a sketch of this man.

710
00:36:22,486 --> 00:36:25,731
Some of his face is missing.

711
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,977
There's, like, a scar here.

712
00:36:29,012 --> 00:36:31,013
He's from way back.

713
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:37,923
Wow.

714
00:36:39,025 --> 00:36:40,491
****

715
00:36:40,526 --> 00:36:42,895
What's with the face?

716
00:36:42,896 --> 00:36:44,998
It was an injury.

717
00:36:45,033 --> 00:36:48,471
I don't know if he was shot,
stabbed, cut.

718
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,277
I don't like him
looking at me.

719
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:54,912
To tell you the truth,

720
00:36:54,947 --> 00:36:57,850
seeing a sketch of an entity
that is in this restaurant --

721
00:36:57,885 --> 00:36:59,185
I was freaked out,

722
00:36:59,186 --> 00:37:01,588
especially since
I hadn't seen him before.

723
00:37:01,623 --> 00:37:06,229
It had a face, and then it,
to me, became way scarier.

724
00:37:06,264 --> 00:37:10,619
In the basement, I saw people,
and they died in a fire.

725
00:37:10,654 --> 00:37:14,974
They're very angry about that,
and they want revenge.

726
00:37:15,009 --> 00:37:17,043
If you were to see them,

727
00:37:17,078 --> 00:37:20,682
it would look like
a child-sized black mist.

728
00:37:20,717 --> 00:37:24,252
Back in 1889,
there was the big fire here.

729
00:37:24,287 --> 00:37:28,225
It was probably the worst fire
in Seattle's history.

730
00:37:28,226 --> 00:37:29,996
You said it was a mist, right?

731
00:37:32,733 --> 00:37:37,504
One night, it just got misty
over in the corner.

732
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:39,876
It was dark, like where
you could not see through it.

733
00:37:39,911 --> 00:37:42,580
And then we ran out.

734
00:37:42,615 --> 00:37:44,079
My gosh.

735
00:37:44,114 --> 00:37:48,019
What Amy told me about the mist
hit home a little bit.

736
00:37:48,054 --> 00:37:51,925
I was really surprised
at how accurate that really was.

737
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,029
And, to me, that is terrifying.

738
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,817
How'd the rest of the walk go?

739
00:37:57,852 --> 00:38:00,571
So, I'm downstairs,
and I'm by the bathrooms,

740
00:38:00,606 --> 00:38:03,974
and this lady comes out.

741
00:38:04,009 --> 00:38:07,916
She was really,
really religious,

742
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:10,452
and she has a lot of power.

743
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:17,060
She goes after people
who are weak...

744
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:18,662
and especially women.

745
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:21,617
And when she touches
people...

746
00:38:21,652 --> 00:38:24,538
it's like a death sentence.

747
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:28,575
21/2, 3 weeks ago,

748
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:31,932
I had pneumonia
in my right lung.

749
00:38:31,967 --> 00:38:34,394
Then the bacteria
from my pneumonia

750
00:38:34,429 --> 00:38:36,822
had actually got
into my bloodstream.

751
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:38,289
My gosh.

752
00:38:38,324 --> 00:38:39,659
And I thought
I was gonna die.

753
00:38:39,694 --> 00:38:42,113
I was a mess -- a mess.

754
00:38:42,148 --> 00:38:44,497
I think it was her.

755
00:38:44,532 --> 00:38:47,269
When Amy said
the woman downstairs

756
00:38:47,304 --> 00:38:49,171
was trying to kill me,

757
00:38:49,172 --> 00:38:51,341
that's when
I became freaked out.

758
00:38:51,376 --> 00:38:53,479
The wife of F.X. Schreiner --

759
00:38:53,514 --> 00:38:56,000
she was a very pious,
religious woman.

760
00:38:56,035 --> 00:38:58,545
Didn't like the fact
that her husband

761
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,056
was making money
with prostitutes.

762
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:03,224
Her name was Mary.

763
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:06,130
Do you think the woman you saw
is this Mary Schreiner?

764
00:39:07,531 --> 00:39:10,269
It could be.

765
00:39:17,411 --> 00:39:20,784
So, Darcy, you've seen the
results of the investigation.

766
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:22,216
The big question is,

767
00:39:22,251 --> 00:39:25,639
is it safe for you,
your employees to be here?

768
00:39:25,674 --> 00:39:29,028
It's not really safe for you
to be here right now.

769
00:39:29,063 --> 00:39:33,901
The way to get rid of her
is to find a medium

770
00:39:33,936 --> 00:39:37,205
who has a background
in counseling.

771
00:39:37,206 --> 00:39:41,645
If the medium isn't making
any headway with her,

772
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,085
then you're going to have to
make her leave,

773
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,157
and that involves
a type of exorcism.

774
00:39:52,761 --> 00:39:54,263
Now, what kind of a risk
are we talking about with her

775
00:39:54,298 --> 00:39:56,299
if she doesn't listen to you?

776
00:39:56,334 --> 00:39:59,071
Well, she'd kill her.

777
00:40:00,371 --> 00:40:03,008
As far as he's concerned,

778
00:40:03,043 --> 00:40:05,610
I think he should stay.

779
00:40:05,645 --> 00:40:08,214
I know<i> you</i>
don't want to hear that.

780
00:40:08,249 --> 00:40:13,223
If we can play along well,
then I'm okay with that.

781
00:40:14,825 --> 00:40:18,196
Darcy, it sounds like
we got here just in time.

782
00:40:18,231 --> 00:40:20,066
What are you gonna do?

783
00:40:36,689 --> 00:40:40,627
Amy told me to get a medium
and if that didn't work,

784
00:40:40,662 --> 00:40:42,965
to get a priest
to do an exorcism.

785
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,264
I opted out of that.

786
00:40:44,299 --> 00:40:46,301
I figured,
"Well, if the woman downstairs

787
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,469
"is trying to kill me,

788
00:40:47,504 --> 00:40:49,423
why waste my time
with a medium?"

789
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:51,342
And so I went
straight for the priest

790
00:40:51,377 --> 00:40:53,212
to do the exorcism.

791
00:40:57,951 --> 00:40:59,753
Holy Mary, mother of God,

792
00:40:59,788 --> 00:41:02,088
grant us protection
under your mantle,

793
00:41:02,123 --> 00:41:04,561
for we seek refuge
from all worldly dangers.

794
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:06,548
When he was doing the exorcism,

795
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:08,465
the restaurant
seemed to get colder...

796
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,038
Give us strength
to defend our mortal souls.

797
00:41:12,073 --> 00:41:14,341
...and colder and colder.

798
00:41:14,376 --> 00:41:16,542
And treat the Lord of Peace

799
00:41:16,577 --> 00:41:19,748
to cast Satan down
under our feet.

800
00:41:19,783 --> 00:41:22,151
I cast you out, Satan,

801
00:41:22,186 --> 00:41:24,489
and all you demons
and your minions.

802
00:41:26,992 --> 00:41:30,831
And then, after the exorcism,

803
00:41:30,866 --> 00:41:32,464
he blessed me.

804
00:41:32,499 --> 00:41:35,971
Have mercy on Darcy
and heal Darcy's sickness,

805
00:41:35,972 --> 00:41:38,875
and on the day of Darcy's death,
strengthen her soul.

806
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:42,331
Deliver Darcy not into
the hand of her enemies --

807
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:45,752
to the Father and to the Son
and to the Holy Spirit.

808
00:41:45,787 --> 00:41:47,287
Amen.

809
00:41:53,396 --> 00:41:55,765
Since the priest
did the exorcism,

810
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,801
I'm not sick anymore,

811
00:41:57,802 --> 00:42:01,974
and I'm hopeful that my guests
won't be uneasy any longer.

812
00:42:02,009 --> 00:42:03,910
But I still have concerns.

813
00:42:03,945 --> 00:42:05,444
Evil could come back.

814
00:42:05,445 --> 00:42:06,913
But either way,

815
00:42:06,948 --> 00:42:10,419
I would still continue to run
this restaurant the way I do.

816
00:42:12,689 --> 00:42:15,058
While I think Darcy's decision

817
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:17,427
to have an exorcism first
was premature,

818
00:42:17,462 --> 00:42:21,068
I do understand her reasons
for making such a drastic move.

819
00:42:21,103 --> 00:42:24,639
But an exorcism on its own
is never a guaranteed cure,

820
00:42:24,674 --> 00:42:26,876
and I just hope
it'll be enough

821
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:29,078
to keep the activity
under control.
