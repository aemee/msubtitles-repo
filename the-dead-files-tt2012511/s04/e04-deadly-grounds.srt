1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:08,985
It's been here forever.

3
00:00:08,986 --> 00:00:11,886
It's making them crazy.

4
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:14,745
I'm scared of the woods.

5
00:00:14,746 --> 00:00:16,824
She's seeing monsters.

6
00:00:16,825 --> 00:00:19,136
They can get in the house.

7
00:00:19,137 --> 00:00:21,612
It's very concerning.

8
00:00:21,613 --> 00:00:24,935
I walked into a black mass.

9
00:00:24,936 --> 00:00:26,125
Satanic.

10
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:29,728
Then they killed the
mother and the father.

11
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:31,829
So bad.

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,590
Secrets are buried deep here.

13
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:39,829
They're being watched.

14
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,737
My name is Amy Allan.

15
00:00:42,738 --> 00:00:44,988
This thing likes death.

16
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:46,771
I see dead people.

17
00:00:46,772 --> 00:00:48,339
This thing is, like, a monster.

18
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,409
I speak to dead people.

19
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,099
And he's pissed off now.

20
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,608
And they speak to me.

21
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:55,204
His head was cracked.

22
00:00:55,205 --> 00:00:58,184
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

23
00:00:58,185 --> 00:01:00,234
This guy was murdered.

24
00:01:00,235 --> 00:01:01,653
I rely on my partner.

25
00:01:01,654 --> 00:01:05,008
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

26
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:07,726
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

27
00:01:07,727 --> 00:01:10,819
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

28
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,732
You saw her? It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:14,885
Why would you stay here?

30
00:01:14,886 --> 00:01:17,009
But Steve and I never speak...

31
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,993
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:20,405
Until the very end.

33
00:01:20,406 --> 00:01:22,179
Stop it.

34
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,343
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

35
00:01:24,344 --> 00:01:26,749
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

36
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,104
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:32,845
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

38
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:54,210
Amy and I have handled
dozens of cases together,

39
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:57,513
and we always follow one key rule...

40
00:01:57,514 --> 00:02:01,148
We don't discuss our
findings until the very end.

41
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:04,753
I interview witnesses and uncover
the property's dark secrets,

42
00:02:04,754 --> 00:02:07,957
while Amy communicates with the dead.

43
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:11,619
I'm in northern Indiana in
the small town of Wabash.

44
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,765
Amy and I were called in by a mother of
three who sounded very upset on the phone.

45
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:19,068
She says she has violent
spirits in the house

46
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:21,603
and that the spirits are
targeting her children.

47
00:02:21,604 --> 00:02:26,704
I'm hoping Amy and I can
give her some answers.

48
00:02:35,853 --> 00:02:38,154
Before Amy arrives, I
clear the area of anything

49
00:02:38,155 --> 00:02:42,055
that could influence her findings.

50
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:45,394
This house has a lot of
photographs and children's toys,

51
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:48,097
so I need to be careful to
remove any leading evidence

52
00:02:48,098 --> 00:02:53,018
about the family living
here before she begins.

53
00:03:13,757 --> 00:03:17,177
There is a doorway here...

54
00:03:17,494 --> 00:03:20,674
For... for dead people.

55
00:03:21,064 --> 00:03:26,404
But I opened it, and it
was, like, endless darkness.

56
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,438
And it's a darkness...

57
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,979
That's layers of depression.

58
00:03:33,676 --> 00:03:36,930
These dark, black hands...

59
00:03:36,931 --> 00:03:39,982
Came out to grab me.

60
00:03:39,983 --> 00:03:43,883
And it wanted to wrap me in it.

61
00:03:53,397 --> 00:03:56,957
So, Suzanne, when I spoke to you on
the phone, you sounded very upset.

62
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,701
So, now that I'm here, why don't
you explain what's going on?

63
00:03:59,702 --> 00:04:03,084
Well, we've been having a
lot of experiences here...

64
00:04:03,085 --> 00:04:06,971
Um myself, my husband, my three kids.

65
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:11,412
Okay. Like what? Give me a for instance.

66
00:04:14,186 --> 00:04:17,306
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

67
00:04:17,432 --> 00:04:19,255
It really gets down deep.

68
00:04:19,256 --> 00:04:24,956
All right. Why don't you
tell me about what's going on?

69
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:29,265
Lots of stuff out of
the corner of your eye.

70
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:32,053
We've seen an apparition.

71
00:04:32,054 --> 00:04:34,814
Footsteps, voices.

72
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:42,783
I just don't want my children
to be scared of their own house.

73
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:44,704
Okay.

74
00:04:44,848 --> 00:04:46,930
And they are.

75
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:49,986
I don't know how to make it better.

76
00:04:49,987 --> 00:04:54,829
I want them to be comfortable
here in their own home.

77
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,812
I don't think there's
a rule book on this.

78
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:58,613
No.

79
00:04:59,796 --> 00:05:01,444
And how long have you been living here?

80
00:05:01,445 --> 00:05:04,265
About seven years.

81
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:09,012
My husband's family has owned
it for three generations.

82
00:05:09,013 --> 00:05:11,811
Okay, so, do you know any
of the history of the house?

83
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:16,462
I know that the house that was
here previously burnt down...

84
00:05:16,463 --> 00:05:18,623
In 2003.

85
00:05:20,217 --> 00:05:22,336
What caused the fire?

86
00:05:22,337 --> 00:05:25,098
Um, we really aren't sure.

87
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:29,419
We know that one report said a candle.

88
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,220
There's a lot of people around here.

89
00:05:40,221 --> 00:05:43,341
A lot of dead people.

90
00:05:44,915 --> 00:05:48,569
The people out there weren't
bad people when they died.

91
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,390
But now they are.

92
00:05:55,602 --> 00:05:59,682
It was three men that ran in here.

93
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:05,694
There is a fire, a raging fire,
and these idiots don't care.

94
00:06:05,695 --> 00:06:11,515
And they're supposed to be
helping, but they're not gonna.

95
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:23,145
Okay, Suzanne, why did
you bring me in this room?

96
00:06:23,146 --> 00:06:27,916
There was a time when I woke up
in the middle of the night to a...

97
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:30,868
What I thought was a
man's voice yelling, hey,

98
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:34,788
on the baby monitor, and
then she started screaming.

99
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:37,427
I ran into the bedroom to get her.

100
00:06:37,428 --> 00:06:42,228
And that's when I
walked into a black mass.

101
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:45,568
Okay, so, what did it look like?

102
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:51,469
Just a black smoke or a fog,
like if you would walk into...

103
00:06:51,948 --> 00:06:53,709
Blackness.

104
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:59,582
And when I walked into it, she
said, monster, and covered her eyes.

105
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,518
She had talked about monsters,

106
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:07,859
and I didn't really believe
her until that happened.

107
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:27,321
There's something here.

108
00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:31,189
It's a big, solid, black mass.

109
00:07:36,186 --> 00:07:40,256
And a bunch of people that
are halfway in the walls.

110
00:07:40,257 --> 00:07:42,591
And they're see-through.

111
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:46,328
Could this maybe be the portal
that you were talking about?

112
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:48,249
Yeah.

113
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:52,277
It's been here for... ever.

114
00:07:53,503 --> 00:07:56,071
Do you know if any of these
people go into the house at all,

115
00:07:56,072 --> 00:07:58,207
besides, like, just these walls?

116
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,342
Yes, they can get in the house.

117
00:08:00,343 --> 00:08:05,023
Okay, and what about
the... the big mass...

118
00:08:05,815 --> 00:08:07,816
That you saw back there?

119
00:08:07,817 --> 00:08:11,237
It's keeping them trapped.

120
00:08:18,328 --> 00:08:22,588
Macy hasn't slept in this room for...

121
00:08:22,865 --> 00:08:24,456
Three years.

122
00:08:24,457 --> 00:08:27,868
One time, which was
really frightening she,

123
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:32,489
told me that a monster
had picked her up.

124
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:34,076
And did what?

125
00:08:34,077 --> 00:08:39,897
She was in the air, and then
she was on the ground again.

126
00:08:40,055 --> 00:08:43,010
And it's really scaring...

127
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:45,229
Us to know that...

128
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:50,375
Now Andy, our 3-year-old, is
seeing the same things that,

129
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:54,135
you know, Macy was talking
about at that same age.

130
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:57,992
There was a time when we
were standing in the kitchen.

131
00:08:57,993 --> 00:09:02,359
And she started... like,
she was talking to somebody.

132
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,807
And she started saying, I
don't want to go in the woods.

133
00:09:05,808 --> 00:09:07,972
I'm scared of the woods.

134
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:10,958
What do you think is
going on in this house?

135
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,599
I don't know. Just... we
would really like some answers.

136
00:09:22,618 --> 00:09:26,856
So, is this portal dangerous
to the living in any way?

137
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,717
Yes.

138
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:31,767
- Became, like, a path.
- Okay.

139
00:09:31,768 --> 00:09:34,640
Like, literally a path.

140
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:37,581
And I feel so bad.

141
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:41,181
I don't feel good here.

142
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:56,178
I don't feel good here.

143
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:01,039
Like, I can't breathe,
and my head is dizzy.

144
00:10:01,384 --> 00:10:05,224
This is where the depression is.

145
00:10:06,423 --> 00:10:08,088
There is a lady here.

146
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:10,839
She rules this structure.

147
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,475
People do see her.

148
00:10:12,476 --> 00:10:15,979
It would be, like, a
white mist, you know? Uh...

149
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:20,720
And a movement, because
she's always moving.

150
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,463
She has a weird...

151
00:10:23,464 --> 00:10:25,595
Uh, sense of humor.

152
00:10:25,596 --> 00:10:31,496
Like, she'd make somebody trip and
fall, and she'd think that's hilarious.

153
00:10:36,946 --> 00:10:38,804
B.J., I was talking to your wife.

154
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,696
She mentioned that you actually grew
up on this property your whole life.

155
00:10:41,697 --> 00:10:46,065
Yes. I am the third
generation to live out here.

156
00:10:46,066 --> 00:10:49,673
I'd love the chance to hand
it down to my kids, but...

157
00:10:49,674 --> 00:10:54,376
I don't want to hand it
down the way it is right now.

158
00:10:54,377 --> 00:10:56,928
Why don't you tell me a little
bit about what's going on?

159
00:10:56,929 --> 00:10:59,731
The thing that's happened with
the kids, first it was Macy.

160
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:02,000
She's the oldest, and
when she was about 3,

161
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:05,503
she started saying that she's
seeing monsters and ghosts.

162
00:11:05,504 --> 00:11:10,369
And that the ghosts were white
and the monsters were black.

163
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:16,270
I thought it was kind of odd, but now that
Andy is 3, Andy has said the same thing.

164
00:11:16,715 --> 00:11:18,750
And now I got a
one-year-old son,

165
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:22,709
and I'm just worried, is
he gonna see the same thing?

166
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,522
Are they experiencing anything else?

167
00:11:24,523 --> 00:11:27,458
Yes, almost every
night, we hear footsteps,

168
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:30,170
and that's throughout
the entire upstairs.

169
00:11:30,171 --> 00:11:33,182
- Was anybody up here?
- No.

170
00:11:33,183 --> 00:11:36,423
It's starting to get very concerning.

171
00:11:36,424 --> 00:11:41,176
In this room, we had something that
would mimic what was being said.

172
00:11:41,177 --> 00:11:43,338
So, whatever you guys are
talking about, something's...

173
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:44,779
- Repeating it.
- Like a parrot?

174
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,430
Yes.

175
00:11:46,431 --> 00:11:47,665
Okay.

176
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:53,164
I want my children to be able to grow
up happy and have a normal childhood.

177
00:11:53,165 --> 00:11:59,065
And feel safe in their home, where
they don't have to worry about monsters.

178
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:15,031
This lady... she is able
to manipulate sound waves.

179
00:12:15,947 --> 00:12:19,899
Like, she can make it sound
like there's a lot of people...

180
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,820
Walking or in a room,
but there's really not.

181
00:12:25,373 --> 00:12:29,213
So, she could make noise, noise.

182
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,046
I do feel like people see her, though.

183
00:12:33,047 --> 00:12:36,169
- Like, the younger people in the house.
- Uh-huh.

184
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:40,349
She is... she'll try to
hear them breathing, and...

185
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,970
You know, she's very
smothering, you know?

186
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:54,668
She wants to make clear
that she's a protector.

187
00:12:54,669 --> 00:12:56,625
Why do you say that? Like...

188
00:12:56,626 --> 00:13:01,906
Because she thinks that
the adults here are satanic.

189
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:07,847
This is by far the most
uncomfortable room for me.

190
00:13:07,848 --> 00:13:08,993
Why?

191
00:13:08,994 --> 00:13:11,778
When I'm laying here, every once
in a while, I can catch a shadow,

192
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:14,659
run past the door.

193
00:13:15,122 --> 00:13:18,361
Now let me ask a question, you
got big windows here could it be,

194
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:21,328
from cars or trucks coming up the road?

195
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:23,362
I seriously doubt it.

196
00:13:23,363 --> 00:13:24,831
Anything else in this room?

197
00:13:24,832 --> 00:13:28,271
Yes. I got up in the morning
to get ready for work,

198
00:13:28,272 --> 00:13:31,457
and it's not uncommon for
Andy, our middle child,

199
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,834
to come in some time in the middle
of the night and climb in bed with us.

200
00:13:34,835 --> 00:13:39,788
So, as I'm getting up, I see a little
blond-haired girl laying in bed.

201
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:43,725
So I just think it's Andy, she came
in. So, I cover her up with the covers,

202
00:13:43,726 --> 00:13:47,563
go get ready, come back out,
get ready to leave for work,

203
00:13:47,564 --> 00:13:50,533
and I asked my wife where Andy was.

204
00:13:50,534 --> 00:13:54,970
She said that Andy slept
in her room all night.

205
00:13:54,971 --> 00:13:57,106
B.J., has anything else happened?

206
00:13:57,107 --> 00:13:58,140
Yes.

207
00:13:58,141 --> 00:14:00,242
- I was laying in bed.
- Okay.

208
00:14:00,243 --> 00:14:02,214
As I was laying there I felt,

209
00:14:02,215 --> 00:14:06,818
like something came up and
grabbed my arm like this.

210
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:08,283
- Hard?
- Hard.

211
00:14:08,284 --> 00:14:09,818
- Were you in bed alone?
- Yes.

212
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:13,659
There was no one there. Nothing.

213
00:14:18,214 --> 00:14:23,614
This lady... she has so
much control over this house.

214
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:28,603
She's, uh, pious, she says.

215
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:32,208
She thinks that the reason
why she's still here...

216
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:33,409
Mm-hmm.

217
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,530
Is to do God's work.

218
00:14:38,648 --> 00:14:42,184
I don't think she likes
some people in the house.

219
00:14:42,185 --> 00:14:44,819
She feels they're...

220
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,639
Satanic.

221
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,300
She has to protect, because...

222
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,080
They're unholy people.

223
00:14:55,815 --> 00:15:00,969
She's talking about somebody having
or they've had or they're gonna...

224
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:04,873
Gonna have a near-death experience?

225
00:15:04,874 --> 00:15:06,609
That'll bring them closer to God.

226
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,992
Is that somebody that's living
or someone that's here now?

227
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:15,213
It's a male that she
really wants to do this to.

228
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,375
It's obvious that B.J. and
Suzanne are experiencing a lot,

229
00:15:33,376 --> 00:15:37,997
but they don't seem to know much
about the property they're living on.

230
00:15:37,998 --> 00:15:40,463
So my first stop is
to the town archivist.

231
00:15:40,464 --> 00:15:46,364
She said she found something that
may be really interesting to my case.

232
00:15:53,783 --> 00:15:57,042
So, Heather, what were you able to find
out about the property I'm investigating?

233
00:15:57,043 --> 00:16:00,437
Well, in my research
I found that Maggie and

234
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:03,290
Edwin Williams were the
first white settlers.

235
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,669
What do you mean, white settlers?

236
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,482
Well, the land was actually
owned by a Miami Indian tribe.

237
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:10,125
Okay. So what can you tell
me about the Williamses?

238
00:16:10,126 --> 00:16:13,629
They were devout Christians.
They were Presbyterians.

239
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,427
They were active in their small church.

240
00:16:16,428 --> 00:16:19,840
There was a small schoolhouse nearby.
The kids would go to school there.

241
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:21,699
They could, you know, worship there.

242
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,023
- How many kids did they have?
- They had six.

243
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,275
Did anybody from the family
actually die on the property?

244
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:30,045
Yeah, actually, Edwin,
the father, he died first.

245
00:16:30,046 --> 00:16:32,806
Here's his obit.

246
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:37,387
- He was a young guy.
- He was. He was about 40.

247
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:39,377
So, it looks like he died of pneumonia?

248
00:16:39,378 --> 00:16:42,596
That's right, yeah. That was
very common back in those days.

249
00:16:42,597 --> 00:16:46,018
Okay, so, he has a wife and
six kids. How did they make out?

250
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:48,987
Uh, not very well, because
about six weeks later,

251
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:51,734
Maggie died, too, and here's her obit.

252
00:16:51,735 --> 00:16:55,335
- You're kidding me.
- Nope.

253
00:16:57,178 --> 00:17:00,180
- She was a young woman.
- Yeah, she was. She was about 38.

254
00:17:00,181 --> 00:17:03,483
And according to this,
she died of heart disease.

255
00:17:03,484 --> 00:17:06,244
Well... allegedly.

256
00:17:06,467 --> 00:17:08,267
What do you mean, allegedly?

257
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:12,888
Well, I think she
died of a broken heart.

258
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,735
As far as the depression...

259
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:24,496
It's pretty bad.

260
00:17:24,672 --> 00:17:29,777
Well, she has this depression
from losing her family.

261
00:17:29,778 --> 00:17:33,213
I think because her husband died.

262
00:17:33,214 --> 00:17:37,484
She was probably like
thirty two, thirty three.

263
00:17:37,485 --> 00:17:39,747
She's alone. She was alone.

264
00:17:39,748 --> 00:17:44,457
When I bring up the death of loved ones,
this religious lady gets very angry.

265
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:48,561
She feels like she's let her family
down, and she won't let it happen again.

266
00:17:48,562 --> 00:17:52,232
She wants to make clear
that she is a protector.

267
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:55,631
I think she feels like she failed.

268
00:17:55,632 --> 00:17:59,952
I think she'd like to raise the kids.

269
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,316
Heather says the
property I'm investigating

270
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:09,216
used to be owned by Native Americans.

271
00:18:09,217 --> 00:18:12,737
I'm on my way to meet with a
local member of the Miami tribe.

272
00:18:12,738 --> 00:18:15,835
He says his people's time on
B.J. and Suzanne's property,

273
00:18:15,836 --> 00:18:19,256
was filled with heartbreak.

274
00:18:23,932 --> 00:18:26,733
Now, I understand that the
property I'm investigating,

275
00:18:26,734 --> 00:18:29,169
the Miami tribe actually
owned it at some point.

276
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:33,406
The first person it was ever allotted
to... his name was Poqua Godfroy.

277
00:18:33,407 --> 00:18:38,508
He was a son of the last war Chief, Chief
Francis Godfroy of the Miami Indians.

278
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:44,151
And, you know, I got a picture of his
father, Chief Francis Godfroy, right here.

279
00:18:44,152 --> 00:18:46,987
Matter of fact, he was
my fourth-Great Uncle.

280
00:18:46,988 --> 00:18:49,256
So, John, what can you
tell me about Poqua?

281
00:18:49,257 --> 00:18:52,392
Poqua was pretty rowdy. He had a temper.

282
00:18:52,393 --> 00:18:54,419
He used to drink quite a bit.

283
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:59,783
Poqua was living in a time
where their land was being took.

284
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:04,016
The 1938 treaty with The
United States government called

285
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:07,245
for the removal of the Miamis
from the state of Indiana.

286
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:12,346
And it shows them putting
the Miamis at gunpoint.

287
00:19:13,805 --> 00:19:19,126
They took them and moved them 750 miles
away from their homelands to Kansas.

288
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:23,023
And a lot of them perished the
first winter after they got there.

289
00:19:23,024 --> 00:19:25,404
Did Poqua die on the property?

290
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:28,760
He fell off a horse, and
they said he broke his neck.

291
00:19:28,761 --> 00:19:30,681
Okay.

292
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:40,740
Okay, that, like...
this shouldn't be here.

293
00:19:40,741 --> 00:19:44,041
Ah, we've got a griper.

294
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,977
Native American.

295
00:19:48,978 --> 00:19:53,718
She doesn't like it,
she is pissed about...

296
00:19:53,837 --> 00:19:56,357
This building.

297
00:19:57,965 --> 00:20:02,525
The ground was sacred
to Native Americans.

298
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:09,502
You bury your dead there, and you think,
oh, that's good. Like, the tainted...

299
00:20:09,503 --> 00:20:15,023
You think it's good ground,
but it's not good ground.

300
00:20:15,076 --> 00:20:18,011
The people go and bury
their dead people there,

301
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:21,367
and it brings them back, but
they're all [Bleep] mental.

302
00:20:21,368 --> 00:20:24,128
This isn't good.

303
00:20:25,101 --> 00:20:28,886
And it's because of
that black mass thing.

304
00:20:28,887 --> 00:20:32,657
How do you think the living
might experience this black mass?

305
00:20:32,658 --> 00:20:36,618
A definite feeling of intimidation.

306
00:20:38,063 --> 00:20:41,723
A sense of overwhelming dread.

307
00:20:42,894 --> 00:20:44,814
Fear.

308
00:21:00,053 --> 00:21:04,564
So far, I've got a family that's being
terrorized by unexplained activity.

309
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:08,994
And a property connected to a
lot of Native American suffering.

310
00:21:08,995 --> 00:21:13,405
But I need to see if
there's anything else.

311
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:15,576
Digging through the archives,
I'm shocked to discover

312
00:21:15,577 --> 00:21:20,073
a mass murder that
took place in the 1850s.

313
00:21:20,074 --> 00:21:25,974
Turns out, this violent crime happened
directly adjacent to my client's property.

314
00:21:30,618 --> 00:21:32,500
I've worked countless murder scenes,

315
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:35,779
but this is one of the most gruesome
crimes I've ever come across...

316
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,698
An entire family bludgeoned to death.

317
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:40,967
I'm heading over to meet
with the County historian,

318
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:43,670
just a mile away from where
the murders took place.

319
00:21:43,671 --> 00:21:49,571
He tells me it's the worst
massacre in the history of Wabash.

320
00:21:57,451 --> 00:22:01,131
So, Ron, why did you want to meet here?

321
00:22:01,132 --> 00:22:05,435
This cabin is very similar to the
one that the French family was...

322
00:22:05,436 --> 00:22:08,436
Brutally murdered in.

323
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:14,424
The French family consisted of mom
and dad and their five children.

324
00:22:14,425 --> 00:22:16,026
Out of the goodness of their heart,

325
00:22:16,027 --> 00:22:19,620
they invited in to live with
them another family that were

326
00:22:19,621 --> 00:22:22,909
even in poorer circumstances
than themselves...

327
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,911
John and Sarah Hubbard
and their son, Richard.

328
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:30,116
And later on, things came
to a head between the family.

329
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:33,683
They had not been getting
along too well to begin with.

330
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:39,584
John Hubbard and his wife, Sarah,
decided to dispose of the French family.

331
00:22:40,494 --> 00:22:46,394
Using a small hammer, they bashed in
the heads of the sleeping five children.

332
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:52,471
And then they killed the mother and
the father, also with the same hammer.

333
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:57,632
And buried them underneath
the floor of the cabin.

334
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:04,751
I am seeing a graveyard.

335
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:09,221
In the graveyard, somebody
threw an antique shovel at me.

336
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,810
And told me to start digging.

337
00:23:11,811 --> 00:23:15,095
And there were these little mounds.

338
00:23:15,096 --> 00:23:19,536
At least six mounds, three on each side.

339
00:23:23,286 --> 00:23:27,762
I think that those
little mounds are bones.

340
00:23:27,763 --> 00:23:31,065
And there is a dead person...

341
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:34,186
Who committed murder...

342
00:23:34,712 --> 00:23:37,412
In a weird way.

343
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:47,733
Secrets and scandals
are buried deep here.

344
00:23:49,631 --> 00:23:52,301
What was the break in the case?

345
00:23:52,302 --> 00:23:57,648
The break in the case was
another murder... Edward Boyle.

346
00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:00,609
He was about 45 to 50 years old.

347
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,697
He was a laborer on the
rail road that they were

348
00:24:03,698 --> 00:24:06,182
putting in through Wabash
County at that time.

349
00:24:06,183 --> 00:24:08,650
We know he had some kind of education,

350
00:24:08,651 --> 00:24:14,023
and we know that he had about $300 to
$500 saved from working on the rail road.

351
00:24:14,024 --> 00:24:18,944
Back then, average man
made about $300 a year.

352
00:24:19,064 --> 00:24:22,910
And John Hubbard struck
up his acquaintance.

353
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:25,835
And they became friends.

354
00:24:25,836 --> 00:24:28,670
And John offered him a place to stay.

355
00:24:28,671 --> 00:24:32,691
After that, Edward Boyle disappears.

356
00:24:36,982 --> 00:24:39,802
There's this guy.

357
00:24:40,476 --> 00:24:43,176
Very, very rich.

358
00:24:43,293 --> 00:24:46,688
He didn't know a lot of people here.

359
00:24:46,689 --> 00:24:50,049
And then he went missing.

360
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:59,650
I feel like he was going on a business
meeting, and then he just disappeared.

361
00:25:01,072 --> 00:25:03,712
It was set up.

362
00:25:04,174 --> 00:25:07,409
Oh, I'm gonna say he was murdered.

363
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,079
Hubbard is seen in town
spending a lot of money...

364
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,206
Money that he had never had
before... and Boyle was gone.

365
00:25:14,207 --> 00:25:16,249
Detectives put two and two together.

366
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,154
They come looking for Hubbard
and start talking to him.

367
00:25:19,155 --> 00:25:20,946
Now, what was the cause
of death for Boyle?

368
00:25:20,947 --> 00:25:24,493
He had been bludgeoned to death
and then he had been stabbed.

369
00:25:24,494 --> 00:25:27,292
How far was the body found from
the property I'm investigating?

370
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:29,464
About a half mile or less.

371
00:25:29,465 --> 00:25:33,269
Okay, so, how does that murder tie
into the murders of the French family?

372
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:36,500
One day, Mrs. Hubbard
decided to visit her husband

373
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:40,309
while he was in jail facing
charges on that murder.

374
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:44,653
He asked his wife, how's
the family under the floor?

375
00:25:44,654 --> 00:25:49,544
And it just happened to be that there were
two detectives sitting out there listening,

376
00:25:49,545 --> 00:25:53,312
and from that, they decided
to come to the house.

377
00:25:53,313 --> 00:25:55,515
So, now, what happens to Hubbard?

378
00:25:55,516 --> 00:25:57,740
Hubbard is uh...

379
00:25:57,741 --> 00:26:01,821
Tried, found guilty, and he's hung.

380
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,432
Now, what happened to the wife?

381
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:07,933
She spends the rest of her life in jail.

382
00:26:14,368 --> 00:26:17,980
There was several entities
that stood out during my walk.

383
00:26:17,981 --> 00:26:23,085
But what has me the most concerned
is the portal in the basement.

384
00:26:23,086 --> 00:26:25,785
One of these walls...

385
00:26:25,786 --> 00:26:31,426
Had, like, a tiny little
pathway coming out of the wall.

386
00:26:31,995 --> 00:26:36,195
Halfway out of the wall are two men.

387
00:26:37,941 --> 00:26:41,001
They were translucent.

388
00:26:44,274 --> 00:26:47,394
Is this what you saw?

389
00:26:48,497 --> 00:26:50,357
Yes.

390
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:20,100
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations.

391
00:27:20,101 --> 00:27:22,435
We are ready to reveal
our findings to each other.

392
00:27:22,436 --> 00:27:26,516
And our clients for the first time.

393
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:31,045
Amy, I want to introduce
you to B.J. and Suzanne.

394
00:27:31,046 --> 00:27:32,980
They've lived here
for about eight years.

395
00:27:32,981 --> 00:27:37,099
They've been experiencing stuff ever since
they moved in, but basically dealt with it.

396
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,587
Key thing that changed now is
they have three beautiful children.

397
00:27:40,588 --> 00:27:43,439
And two of the older ones
are experiencing things,

398
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,124
that make them so scared, they
don't even want to stay in the house.

399
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:48,607
With that, I'm gonna ask
Amy to tell us about her walk

400
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:53,468
and see if we can find
out what's going on.

401
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:03,249
So, one thing that I got was inside
the house, and it was a female.

402
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:07,090
And she is very, very religious.

403
00:28:07,376 --> 00:28:10,465
She believes that this
house is her domain.

404
00:28:10,466 --> 00:28:12,419
Her husband died.

405
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:17,257
She has a huge amount of
depression surrounding his death.

406
00:28:17,258 --> 00:28:20,556
And she also felt like
she let down her children.

407
00:28:20,557 --> 00:28:24,217
She looked like she
was in her early 30s.

408
00:28:24,218 --> 00:28:27,681
Well, that's interesting you
say that because the first white

409
00:28:27,682 --> 00:28:32,849
settlers to live on your property were a
young couple, Edwin and Margaret Williams.

410
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:35,820
He died at the age of 40 of pneumonia.

411
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:37,109
Oh.

412
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,791
Five to six weeks later, she dies.

413
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:43,232
She died at the age of
38. She had six children.

414
00:28:43,233 --> 00:28:47,265
According to the obituary,
she dies of heart disease.

415
00:28:47,266 --> 00:28:49,660
Her emotion does spill
out into the house...

416
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:55,481
Like, her emotional state, which
is really severe depression.

417
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,312
Several years ago, B.J.,

418
00:29:00,313 --> 00:29:03,695
had a really bad bout of depression...

419
00:29:03,696 --> 00:29:05,916
Very bad.

420
00:29:10,098 --> 00:29:12,078
And...

421
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:18,191
And it took a couple of years
for him to come up out of it.

422
00:29:18,485 --> 00:29:22,505
The dead will influence the living.

423
00:29:25,571 --> 00:29:28,894
Well, I think she
really loved her husband.

424
00:29:28,895 --> 00:29:32,177
She probably felt guilt
for leaving the children,

425
00:29:32,178 --> 00:29:35,280
and she's always watching you guys.

426
00:29:35,281 --> 00:29:38,941
You do not have privacy here.

427
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:46,791
If people do see her, it would
be more like a white mist.

428
00:29:46,792 --> 00:29:50,140
Macy, when she was 3,
would tell us that...

429
00:29:50,141 --> 00:29:52,964
Monsters are black and ghosts are white.

430
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:55,524
And now our three-year-old...

431
00:29:55,525 --> 00:29:58,351
Has told me just recently...

432
00:29:58,352 --> 00:30:01,540
Monsters are black and ghosts are white.

433
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:03,007
Ooh.

434
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:07,060
Almost every night, we hear
footsteps upstairs on the loft.

435
00:30:07,061 --> 00:30:09,514
She can mess with sound waves.

436
00:30:09,515 --> 00:30:13,518
What kind of things would
she be able to make them hear?

437
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:18,723
People walking around, a lot of
people talking, someone talking.

438
00:30:18,724 --> 00:30:21,891
Macy was upstairs and...

439
00:30:21,892 --> 00:30:26,512
She told us that a
monster picked her up.

440
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:30,054
When the kids are seeing this
white thing, do you think it's her?

441
00:30:30,055 --> 00:30:32,003
Yeah. That's how she would appear.

442
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:34,781
But I don't think she's
the one lifting them up.

443
00:30:34,782 --> 00:30:37,902
That's something else.

444
00:30:39,102 --> 00:30:43,281
I know what the woman,
the white mist, wants.

445
00:30:43,282 --> 00:30:46,874
She actually wants to
protect the children.

446
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:49,287
She might come across as smothering.

447
00:30:49,288 --> 00:30:53,608
She's felt that you guys were satanic.

448
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,262
Well, let me ask you a question
flat-out. You guys religious?

449
00:30:58,263 --> 00:31:00,085
Go to church? You don't go to church?

450
00:31:00,086 --> 00:31:02,133
- We don't.
- No, we don't go to church.

451
00:31:02,134 --> 00:31:05,648
The whole thing is, is when
you get religious zealots,

452
00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:09,862
they believe that it's
their way or no way.

453
00:31:09,863 --> 00:31:13,745
And she was extreme
in her belief system.

454
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:19,646
And she really does have her
sights set on you, in particular.

455
00:31:20,073 --> 00:31:24,256
She feels like she is
here to lead you to God.

456
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,654
That's her mission.

457
00:31:25,655 --> 00:31:30,688
And you, in particular, she feels the
only way she can do that with you is...

458
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:33,929
A near-death experience.

459
00:31:36,168 --> 00:31:37,926
What else did you see?

460
00:31:37,927 --> 00:31:41,346
Outside, I saw a graveyard.

461
00:31:41,347 --> 00:31:44,210
Uh, there were a bunch of
mounds. Like, six of them.

462
00:31:44,211 --> 00:31:48,650
And, so, someone threw
me a antique shovel...

463
00:31:48,651 --> 00:31:51,656
And told me to start digging.

464
00:31:51,657 --> 00:31:56,024
I think that those
little mounds are bones.

465
00:31:56,025 --> 00:31:59,484
And there is a dead person...

466
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:02,605
Who committed murder...

467
00:32:03,092 --> 00:32:05,792
In a weird way.

468
00:32:07,866 --> 00:32:13,766
I kept hearing somebody say that
scandals and secrets lie deep here.

469
00:32:14,443 --> 00:32:16,808
Well, I don't know if
it's what you saw but,

470
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:20,111
one of the things I came
across is back in 1854...

471
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:22,376
There was a family
by the name of French.

472
00:32:22,377 --> 00:32:26,451
And they took in this couple
called the Hubbards and their son.

473
00:32:26,452 --> 00:32:29,354
So, what the Hubbards wind
up doing is, basically,

474
00:32:29,355 --> 00:32:32,890
one night they got up and they
beat them to death with hammers.

475
00:32:32,891 --> 00:32:34,871
What?!

476
00:32:34,893 --> 00:32:36,951
It was two parents and five children.

477
00:32:36,952 --> 00:32:38,934
Oh, my gosh.

478
00:32:38,935 --> 00:32:42,334
They dug out a shallow
grave underneath...

479
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:45,452
This tiny shack they lived in.

480
00:32:45,453 --> 00:32:49,966
And they buried them
on top of each other.

481
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:55,867
It's probably one of the worst murders
I've come across, and I've seen everything.

482
00:33:04,181 --> 00:33:09,952
So, out back, I saw this man,
and he wasn't from this town,

483
00:33:09,953 --> 00:33:12,025
and he had just kind of come here.

484
00:33:12,026 --> 00:33:15,035
He didn't really know anybody.
And then he went missing.

485
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:20,936
And he was laying in a very shallow
grave, and I knew he was murdered.

486
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:22,913
That's incredible.

487
00:33:22,914 --> 00:33:24,982
There was a guy named Edward Boyle.

488
00:33:24,983 --> 00:33:27,308
Came here to work on the rail roads.

489
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:30,588
John Hubbard befriended this guy.
Next thing you know, he goes missing.

490
00:33:30,589 --> 00:33:33,690
They actually found Edward
Boyle stabbed and beaten

491
00:33:33,691 --> 00:33:39,130
and thrown into a shallow
grave right off the river here.

492
00:33:39,131 --> 00:33:42,399
It's ironic how Hubbard gets
caught for the French murders,

493
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,871
because he's in jail for the Edward Boyle
murder, and his wife comes to visit him.

494
00:33:47,872 --> 00:33:52,042
He says to her, hey, how are those
seven people doing underneath the cabin?

495
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:54,167
This is overheard by a jailer,

496
00:33:54,168 --> 00:33:57,515
who puts two and two together and
says, that whole family who disappeared.

497
00:33:57,516 --> 00:34:01,003
They send some authorities out there,
and as soon as they get towards the cabin,

498
00:34:01,004 --> 00:34:02,653
they could smell death.

499
00:34:02,654 --> 00:34:05,922
- He wound up getting hung.
- What about his wife?

500
00:34:05,923 --> 00:34:07,691
She died in jail.

501
00:34:07,692 --> 00:34:10,134
The murderers of the French family,

502
00:34:10,135 --> 00:34:16,035
would have never been caught had it
not been for the murder of Edward Boyle.

503
00:34:17,101 --> 00:34:19,613
So, how'd the rest of your
walk go? What did you see?

504
00:34:19,614 --> 00:34:24,790
The next thing was I came into
contact with this Native American lady.

505
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:28,109
And she was just going off about,

506
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:32,163
you know, how this was,
like, once sacred ground.

507
00:34:32,164 --> 00:34:36,124
And now it's become very tainted.

508
00:34:37,922 --> 00:34:41,627
Now, your land was owned, at
one time, by the Miami tribe.

509
00:34:41,628 --> 00:34:45,396
Actually, your property itself
was owned by a guy named Francis.

510
00:34:45,397 --> 00:34:47,331
He was the Chief of
the Miami tribe here.

511
00:34:47,332 --> 00:34:50,467
His son, Poqua, owned your land.

512
00:34:50,468 --> 00:34:53,429
Now, I spoke to one of his descendants.

513
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:57,016
And he described Poqua
as a feisty type of guy.

514
00:34:57,017 --> 00:34:58,908
He liked to drink. He was a boozer.

515
00:34:58,909 --> 00:35:02,574
He did not like the
white man whatsoever.

516
00:35:02,575 --> 00:35:05,841
As far as I could tell, they had pretty
good reason, and I'll tell you why.

517
00:35:05,842 --> 00:35:09,130
When the government came in, they
basically took the Miami tribe,

518
00:35:09,131 --> 00:35:13,849
put them on canal boats, and
shipped them off to Kansas.

519
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:17,545
They called it the Great Removal.

520
00:35:17,546 --> 00:35:19,756
Now, I have a picture...

521
00:35:19,757 --> 00:35:23,297
Of how it looked back then.

522
00:35:23,477 --> 00:35:25,189
Oh...

523
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,014
Man. Okay.

524
00:35:27,015 --> 00:35:32,415
- What's that?
- No, I think I figured something out.

525
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:37,239
It makes sense, because... okay,
this is what else I saw, was uh...

526
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,328
I saw about 20 people.

527
00:35:39,329 --> 00:35:43,716
They weren't bad in life, but now
that they're dead, they're twisted.

528
00:35:43,717 --> 00:35:45,353
And um...

529
00:35:45,354 --> 00:35:49,854
They're being held by a huge black mass.

530
00:35:50,354 --> 00:35:53,456
And now I'm thinking it
might have been Poqua.

531
00:35:53,457 --> 00:35:55,636
But what's he doing with them, though?

532
00:35:55,637 --> 00:35:57,827
- Or this mass or whatever.
- He just... I don't know.

533
00:35:57,828 --> 00:36:02,231
He screws them up mentally,
and he just has them trapped.

534
00:36:02,232 --> 00:36:05,167
Is it to torture them or to use them?

535
00:36:05,168 --> 00:36:07,088
Both.

536
00:36:10,173 --> 00:36:13,483
When I went into the
basement, there's a pathway.

537
00:36:13,484 --> 00:36:17,257
That the dead can use to
come in and out of your house.

538
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:22,040
And the people can, and
so can the black mass.

539
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:25,865
They can travel back and forth, and
these dead people can be dangerous.

540
00:36:25,866 --> 00:36:29,466
And have very bad intentions.

541
00:36:50,013 --> 00:36:55,299
These people that are outside,
do they come into the house?

542
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,980
The people can, and
so can the black mass.

543
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:04,881
They can travel back and forth, and
these dead people can be dangerous,

544
00:37:04,882 --> 00:37:10,582
because they're twisted and
they have very bad intentions.

545
00:37:14,908 --> 00:37:18,907
Talking about a black
mass, listen to this story.

546
00:37:18,908 --> 00:37:21,897
One night, her daughter
was actually crying.

547
00:37:21,898 --> 00:37:24,294
She went up to get her
out of the bedroom, and...

548
00:37:24,295 --> 00:37:26,275
And...

549
00:37:26,515 --> 00:37:30,285
When I carried her
back into our bedroom...

550
00:37:30,286 --> 00:37:35,086
All of a sudden, there
was this... blackness.

551
00:37:35,716 --> 00:37:41,236
And she then, like, covered
her eyes and said, monster.

552
00:37:45,798 --> 00:37:49,698
And I knew it was what she saw.

553
00:37:51,174 --> 00:37:54,354
Because I saw it, too.

554
00:37:58,769 --> 00:38:02,369
I did sketch a scene of it.

555
00:38:10,806 --> 00:38:12,666
Wow.

556
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:24,155
It's a pathway for the dead.

557
00:38:24,156 --> 00:38:27,936
And this huge, huge black mass.

558
00:38:31,641 --> 00:38:37,541
I think that a lot of the dead here,
they kind of get sucked in the pathway.

559
00:38:38,587 --> 00:38:41,323
Unfortunately, it seems to
be a pathway that attracts

560
00:38:41,324 --> 00:38:43,959
people who don't understand
what's happened to them.

561
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,896
I mean, are these the people that are...

562
00:38:47,897 --> 00:38:50,032
Talking to my kids?

563
00:38:50,033 --> 00:38:51,893
Yes.

564
00:38:54,126 --> 00:38:59,646
They're going to go for
them because they're so open.

565
00:39:02,946 --> 00:39:05,370
I know this is a lot of
information for you guys.

566
00:39:05,371 --> 00:39:09,784
The big question is,
are your kids safe here?

567
00:39:09,785 --> 00:39:12,420
Is it safe for you guys to stay
here and raise those children?

568
00:39:12,421 --> 00:39:16,438
Well, I can't answer that,
but hopefully Amy can.

569
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:19,789
You love this place, right?

570
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,497
- This is sacred land for you.
- Yes.

571
00:39:22,498 --> 00:39:25,108
And you treat it with respect and love.

572
00:39:25,109 --> 00:39:28,762
So, the first thing I want
you to do is to find a Deacon.

573
00:39:28,763 --> 00:39:31,206
Who can come here...

574
00:39:31,207 --> 00:39:35,310
And do a blessing for
Margaret, the pious woman.

575
00:39:35,311 --> 00:39:38,975
And for you guys and for the
house and for the children.

576
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:44,876
This is going to make her very
happy, because you are embracing...

577
00:39:45,121 --> 00:39:48,190
Her faith in some respect.

578
00:39:48,191 --> 00:39:53,411
So, have him come and do
that... a house blessing.

579
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:57,320
And tell her it's okay to go.

580
00:39:57,822 --> 00:40:03,722
She can go now. She needs to go
to her children and her husband.

581
00:40:04,374 --> 00:40:08,317
The second thing you need
to do is to seal the pathway.

582
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:12,847
You can't close it,
but you can seal it up.

583
00:40:12,848 --> 00:40:18,420
You're going to take two things
that completely seal the dead out.

584
00:40:18,421 --> 00:40:21,024
And that's tar-water and brick dust.

585
00:40:21,025 --> 00:40:25,427
So, I'm gonna give that
to you, and we'll do that.

586
00:40:25,428 --> 00:40:28,363
Tar-water and brick dust
are ancient medicines

587
00:40:28,364 --> 00:40:30,983
often used in ritualistic practices.

588
00:40:30,984 --> 00:40:35,404
When used properly, they can stop
the dead from entering a location.

589
00:40:35,405 --> 00:40:39,374
Now, the last thing you need
to do is deal with Poqua.

590
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:44,137
You're gonna have to
go to the Miami tribe.

591
00:40:44,138 --> 00:40:45,855
And explain what's going on.

592
00:40:45,856 --> 00:40:49,510
This is something I
think that the tribe...

593
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:53,141
Today would not want to see happening.

594
00:40:53,142 --> 00:40:55,962
He's become evil.

595
00:40:56,359 --> 00:41:00,783
We don't want, you know, this legacy of,

596
00:41:00,784 --> 00:41:03,482
hate to continue.

597
00:41:03,483 --> 00:41:06,568
You're going to ask them
to send a medicine man,

598
00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:11,009
to come and have a chat with his elder.

599
00:41:11,524 --> 00:41:13,241
Will this get rid of him?

600
00:41:13,242 --> 00:41:14,989
- Yes.
- Okay.

601
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:18,770
It's coming from his ancestors.

602
00:41:21,917 --> 00:41:26,903
So, the ultimate question is, once they
do all this, do you think they'll be okay?

603
00:41:26,904 --> 00:41:29,428
Will these guys be able to
raise their kids here safely?

604
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:31,438
- Yes.
- Okay.

605
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:35,317
You look like the most
relieved mother I've ever seen.

606
00:41:35,318 --> 00:41:37,210
I think she is.

607
00:41:37,211 --> 00:41:41,540
Now you can pass this land and
this house on to your children,

608
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:44,901
without worrying about it.

609
00:41:45,228 --> 00:41:48,330
I really hope B.J. and
Suzanne follow my advice

610
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:53,851
and deal with the evil that's
terrorizing their family.

611
00:41:54,916 --> 00:41:58,139
With the help of a medicine man
and the tools I've given them,

612
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:04,017
they should be able to free their
home of the darkness that surrounds it.
