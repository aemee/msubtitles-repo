1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:13,779
This dark thing was not a good person.

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,682
Our daughter, she was in sheer terror.

4
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,551
He will pitch a fit.

5
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:20,304
You got a lot of activity.

6
00:00:20,305 --> 00:00:22,152
The women here, he wants to kill 'em.

7
00:00:22,153 --> 00:00:25,155
He stands by the foot of my bed.

8
00:00:25,156 --> 00:00:27,257
He's like a stalker.

9
00:00:27,258 --> 00:00:29,126
Both of their children died.

10
00:00:29,127 --> 00:00:31,006
It hurts, like, here.

11
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:33,829
We can't live like this any longer.

12
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:38,570
This person might have
been a serial killer.

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,201
They're being watched.

14
00:00:41,202 --> 00:00:44,109
My name is Amy Allan.

15
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,360
This thing likes death.

16
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:48,002
I see dead people.

17
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:49,578
This thing is, like, a monster.

18
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:51,781
I speak to dead people.

19
00:00:51,782 --> 00:00:53,322
And he's pissed off now.

20
00:00:53,323 --> 00:00:54,768
And they speak to me.

21
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:56,388
His head was cracked.

22
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,441
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

23
00:00:59,442 --> 00:01:01,491
This guy was murdered.

24
00:01:01,492 --> 00:01:02,910
I rely on my partner.

25
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:06,265
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

26
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,983
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

27
00:01:08,984 --> 00:01:12,076
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

28
00:01:12,077 --> 00:01:14,989
You saw her? It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,142
Why would you stay here?

30
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,266
But Steve and I never speak...

31
00:01:18,267 --> 00:01:20,250
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:21,662
Until the very end.

33
00:01:21,663 --> 00:01:23,436
Stop it.

34
00:01:23,437 --> 00:01:25,600
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

35
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:28,006
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

36
00:01:28,007 --> 00:01:29,361
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:29,362 --> 00:01:34,102
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

38
00:01:48,023 --> 00:01:52,918
Amy and I never cross paths
during an investigation.

39
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:54,594
I interview living
witnesses and look for

40
00:01:54,595 --> 00:01:58,657
dark secrets buried in
the property's past...

41
00:01:58,658 --> 00:02:02,560
While Amy communicates with the dead.

42
00:02:02,561 --> 00:02:05,397
I'm in Manchester, Connecticut,
just east of Hartford.

43
00:02:05,398 --> 00:02:10,011
I received a call from a man named Tom.
He's an ordained minister, a man of God.

44
00:02:10,012 --> 00:02:12,210
He doesn't want to believe
there's evil in his home,

45
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:14,672
but he says he can't
deny it at this point.

46
00:02:14,673 --> 00:02:17,277
He says whatever's there
is ripping his family apart,

47
00:02:17,278 --> 00:02:21,598
and that Amy and I are his last hope.

48
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:40,361
Before Amy arrives, I look for anything
that could influence her findings.

49
00:02:41,817 --> 00:02:44,940
This home has a lot of family
photographs and children's toys,

50
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:47,973
so it's important that
I cover or remove them.

51
00:02:47,974 --> 00:02:53,874
When I'm done, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

52
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:09,470
There is this little girl.

53
00:03:09,471 --> 00:03:15,371
She's freaking out and crying
and panicking, and she's lost...

54
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:17,986
In the woods.

55
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:23,041
She's running from someone,
and she's very scared.

56
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:26,235
She knows that if he catches
her, he's gonna hurt her.

57
00:03:26,236 --> 00:03:27,779
I mean, I know he gets her.

58
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,781
Is this how she died?

59
00:03:29,782 --> 00:03:32,062
Definitely.

60
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,217
Tom, I'm glad I'm here,
because when we spoke,

61
00:03:46,218 --> 00:03:48,040
you sounded pretty
stressed out on the phone.

62
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:51,203
Yeah, there's been a lot of pretty
intense things going on here.

63
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:55,130
Our daughter wakes up in the middle
of the night, screaming for us,

64
00:03:55,131 --> 00:04:00,832
and my wife will go into her room
and sleep with her to comfort her.

65
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,896
As a father, that's
got to be pretty tough.

66
00:04:02,897 --> 00:04:06,647
The look in her face,
just the sheer terror,

67
00:04:06,648 --> 00:04:09,479
it's painful to watch her struggle.

68
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,356
What kind of things are
you experiencing here?

69
00:04:11,357 --> 00:04:14,859
We hear footsteps. We've
seen shadow figures.

70
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,062
We've seen apparitions in the house.

71
00:04:17,063 --> 00:04:19,431
We hear things moving on their own.

72
00:04:19,432 --> 00:04:21,701
A whole variety of
things are going on here.

73
00:04:21,702 --> 00:04:23,600
Now, I understand you're
an ordained minister.

74
00:04:23,601 --> 00:04:24,768
Yes, I am, yeah.

75
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:27,422
So, have you done blessings
on the house yourself?

76
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:32,010
I've done numerous blessings, you
know, both prayers and holy water.

77
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:33,526
It just doesn't stop.

78
00:04:33,527 --> 00:04:35,288
What are you hoping
we can do for you guys?

79
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:40,152
We've gone as far as we can on our own,
and we really need a solution to this.

80
00:04:40,153 --> 00:04:44,293
We can't live like this any longer.

81
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,010
Uh, there's a guy down there.

82
00:04:53,866 --> 00:04:59,760
He's angry, and he's really
trying to make me scared of him.

83
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:02,474
He's saying, "don't come down here".

84
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:05,415
"Get away from me".

85
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:21,105
He only comes down here when
they're trying to get rid of him.

86
00:05:21,106 --> 00:05:23,195
Like, he wants to hide.

87
00:05:23,196 --> 00:05:28,116
When he comes down here,
he will pitch a fit.

88
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:32,053
He's got kind of a dark side.

89
00:05:32,054 --> 00:05:34,514
This is bad.

90
00:05:41,814 --> 00:05:44,549
So, Tom, why'd you bring
me up into this room?

91
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,185
It just gives off a
very oppressive feeling.

92
00:05:47,186 --> 00:05:51,334
We try not even to come down in
this part of the house at night.

93
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:55,960
Tom, I get that you have a feeling in this
place, but what about specific experiences?

94
00:05:55,961 --> 00:06:00,798
I was painting my daughter's playroom,
and I was facing out into the room.

95
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:04,969
At that time, I saw a big, solid
black mass moving down the wall.

96
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,116
It was much taller than
I and broader than I.

97
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:11,443
It couldn't have been, like, a headlight
or any kind of reflection off anything?

98
00:06:11,444 --> 00:06:12,955
It was snowing that particular day,

99
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:16,714
so there wasn't really a situation
to create a shadow like that.

100
00:06:16,715 --> 00:06:17,855
I was stunned.

101
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:20,752
Are there any other experiences
in this part of the house?

102
00:06:20,753 --> 00:06:26,653
At night, I've heard heavy objects
moving, it sounds like, across my desk.

103
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:29,731
So, I wait till the morning, I
come here and look at the desk to

104
00:06:29,732 --> 00:06:33,118
see if anything had been moved,
actually, and nothing had moved.

105
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:35,167
Why don't you come in here
and see what's going on?

106
00:06:35,168 --> 00:06:38,002
Whatever it is, I know that
it's not a physical thing.

107
00:06:38,003 --> 00:06:43,283
It's something that I'm
not equipped to deal with.

108
00:06:50,547 --> 00:06:52,996
This is wrong.

109
00:06:52,997 --> 00:06:58,755
There's a lot of problems
here, specifically in this area.

110
00:06:58,756 --> 00:07:00,564
The man I encountered in the basement

111
00:07:00,565 --> 00:07:03,495
spends most of his time
upstairs in this area.

112
00:07:03,496 --> 00:07:07,899
He hates living people in his space
and has disturbing ways of showing it.

113
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,506
There's a lot of bothering going on.

114
00:07:10,507 --> 00:07:14,654
Can you talk about what he does
up here that might disturb people?

115
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:17,453
I'm hearing, like, stuff
sliding across the floor.

116
00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:19,751
Like, hearing furniture moving.

117
00:07:19,752 --> 00:07:22,992
He will really go nuts.

118
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:31,461
What's going on in here?

119
00:07:31,462 --> 00:07:35,036
I got in bed, and when I
turned over facing this way,

120
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:38,143
there was two girls standing
on the side of my bed.

121
00:07:38,144 --> 00:07:40,973
I was absolutely terrified.

122
00:07:40,974 --> 00:07:45,172
So I kicked out with my leg, and
when I kicked out, they dissipated.

123
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,072
- Describe 'em for me.
- They were bluish.

124
00:07:48,073 --> 00:07:52,207
They were wearing old-fashioned
dresses with lace collars.

125
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:56,305
There's so much stuff going on here
that I started keeping a ghost log on it.

126
00:07:56,306 --> 00:07:59,498
Can I take a look at it?

127
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:03,039
- This is it?
- That's it.

128
00:08:03,822 --> 00:08:05,264
You got a lot of activity.

129
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:11,165
Two months later, my daughter had a friend
sleep over, and she had a strange dream.

130
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,558
And she said in this dream...

131
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:16,829
Three girls came to her.

132
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:21,029
And they were wearing old-fashioned
dresses with lace collars.

133
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,773
And I was just stunned
because I didn't...

134
00:08:24,774 --> 00:08:28,250
I didn't tell Allyson about that. I
absolutely didn't tell the friend about it.

135
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:30,411
And I called you guys the very next day.

136
00:08:30,412 --> 00:08:32,740
And now, in your opinion,
you think this stuff,

137
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:34,819
whatever's here, could be
dangerous to your family?

138
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,820
It's quite possible.

139
00:08:40,493 --> 00:08:42,661
I don't like it.

140
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:45,842
He makes me feel sick.

141
00:08:46,017 --> 00:08:51,897
He's showing me himself as
this, like, creepy, sinister guy.

142
00:08:52,148 --> 00:08:57,089
And that was to try to scare
me off so I wouldn't bother him.

143
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,544
Do you know if he can
do that to other people?

144
00:08:59,545 --> 00:09:02,005
Yes, he can.

145
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:05,776
He can read their minds.

146
00:09:26,588 --> 00:09:28,350
Joanna, I was talking to your husband,

147
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:31,399
and he was telling me you guys are
having a pretty rough time here.

148
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,244
And how are you handling all this?

149
00:09:33,245 --> 00:09:39,145
I imagine for my child safe family,
safe home, where she can be happy.

150
00:09:39,469 --> 00:09:42,393
She's having hard time
going upstairs by herself.

151
00:09:42,394 --> 00:09:44,861
She doesn't go to bed by herself.

152
00:09:44,862 --> 00:09:47,878
It is affecting how she grow.

153
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:52,139
And as a person with hard childhood...

154
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:56,069
I want to make sure that
my child will be safe.

155
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:59,160
One thing I've learned working with
Amy is that unexplained activity,

156
00:09:59,161 --> 00:10:01,985
can also be caused by the
living, not just the dead.

157
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:06,118
So, when a witness tells me she's
had a hard life, I need more details.

158
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:08,988
Joanna, where are you actually
from? What country are you from?

159
00:10:08,989 --> 00:10:11,275
- I'm from Poland.
- Okay.

160
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:16,507
My father worked with the government,
and he was involved with police.

161
00:10:16,508 --> 00:10:19,966
Russians cooperating
with our government.

162
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:22,787
That's my father.

163
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:27,735
What did he do for the government?

164
00:10:27,736 --> 00:10:30,667
He would be the part
of spying on people,

165
00:10:30,668 --> 00:10:34,450
trying to get rid of
everybody who is in his way.

166
00:10:34,451 --> 00:10:38,715
But my mom was opposite
side of the politics.

167
00:10:38,716 --> 00:10:44,476
Which was people trying to be
free, fighting for democracy.

168
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:47,897
And my father, I think he
had anger issue or something,

169
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:52,878
because I saw him putting
gun against her head.

170
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:56,879
So, you watched your father threaten
your mother with a gun to her head?

171
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,560
Yes.

172
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:00,217
Now, do you talk to him at all?

173
00:11:00,218 --> 00:11:02,172
They divorced when I was 18,

174
00:11:02,173 --> 00:11:05,545
and after that, I really
didn't keep in touch with him.

175
00:11:05,546 --> 00:11:10,580
I don't even know if
he's alive, to be honest.

176
00:11:10,581 --> 00:11:14,505
There's this guy. He's kind of stocky.

177
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:18,646
He is some kind of, like, cop or...

178
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:21,058
Investigator.

179
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:24,568
Just a real tough, rough dude.

180
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:27,293
He's looking over things all the time.

181
00:11:27,294 --> 00:11:29,963
He's constantly on patrol.

182
00:11:29,964 --> 00:11:32,241
Do you know when he died?

183
00:11:32,242 --> 00:11:35,362
In the last 20 years?

184
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:41,114
And I'm getting that he was some kind
of grandfather figure or father figure.

185
00:11:41,115 --> 00:11:44,487
- To someone that's here now?
- Yes.

186
00:11:44,488 --> 00:11:47,513
He loves them, but...

187
00:11:47,514 --> 00:11:53,412
I think there's, like, times where he's
seeing things happening here in the house.

188
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:57,165
That he doesn't agree
with or doesn't like,

189
00:11:57,166 --> 00:12:00,570
and that's when he'll
sometimes just snap.

190
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:02,920
Does he express that in any way?

191
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:07,671
He might influence you, like
to feel angry for no reason.

192
00:12:07,672 --> 00:12:13,572
And then I just see, like, black
and yelling, which is his temper.

193
00:12:15,984 --> 00:12:18,890
Why don't you tell me what you've
been experiencing in the house?

194
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:22,353
This four lights we have here...

195
00:12:22,354 --> 00:12:25,011
Three of them, I unscrewed the bulbs

196
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:28,163
because it's too much
for us, for every day.

197
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,963
And we were sitting at the
table, and three of them went on.

198
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:35,900
I'm thinking, that's not
possible, and then they went off.

199
00:12:35,901 --> 00:12:39,237
And those three were
still unscrewed after.

200
00:12:39,238 --> 00:12:41,990
So, how far do you keep
them loose? A couple turns?

201
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:45,127
All the way loose. They're
not in at all, almost.

202
00:12:45,128 --> 00:12:46,578
Okay.

203
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:51,026
But the most disturbing was
actually a couple weeks ago.

204
00:12:51,027 --> 00:12:54,210
I went to bed with my
daughter, and at midnight,

205
00:12:54,211 --> 00:12:58,232
somebody woke me up
touching my shoulder.

206
00:12:58,233 --> 00:13:02,763
And I thought it was Tom,
but there was nobody there.

207
00:13:02,764 --> 00:13:06,384
And if this is what wakes her
up in the middle of the night...

208
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,426
Then I understand why
she always makes sure,

209
00:13:08,427 --> 00:13:12,987
"mommy, will you stay
with me all night?"

210
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,744
I see this, like, black thing.

211
00:13:23,745 --> 00:13:26,484
In life, it was a young man.

212
00:13:26,485 --> 00:13:31,141
Now he's, like, turning
into a stalky, shadowy thing.

213
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:36,002
He doesn't care um,
about personal boundaries.

214
00:13:36,877 --> 00:13:39,937
He's like a stalker.

215
00:13:46,338 --> 00:13:49,009
This weird, dark thing...

216
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,470
Is not good.

217
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:54,612
It was not a good person.

218
00:13:54,613 --> 00:13:56,009
Okay.

219
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:01,910
Like, I think that this person
might have been a serial killer.

220
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:11,990
Allyson, mom and dad say you're
having a tough time in here.

221
00:14:11,991 --> 00:14:13,879
Yeah.

222
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,773
Are you seeing things, they say?

223
00:14:15,774 --> 00:14:17,511
In my dreams...

224
00:14:17,512 --> 00:14:19,521
I see...

225
00:14:19,522 --> 00:14:21,562
People.

226
00:14:21,798 --> 00:14:25,168
First, I was afraid of the dark but...

227
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:28,819
Then I was afraid of the ghost.

228
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,615
A ghost? Like, a man?

229
00:14:31,616 --> 00:14:32,931
Yes.

230
00:14:32,932 --> 00:14:35,931
- Is he an older man? Older than me?
- No.

231
00:14:35,932 --> 00:14:38,183
He's younger than me? Okay.

232
00:14:38,184 --> 00:14:39,547
What does he do?

233
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:42,644
He just stands by the foot of my bed.

234
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:45,391
- Does he stare at you?
- Yeah.

235
00:14:45,392 --> 00:14:47,669
Does he scare you?

236
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,931
We're gonna try to figure out
what's going on here, okay,

237
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:54,672
so this man doesn't
come visit you anymore.

238
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,270
Yes, I see the little girl, yes.

239
00:15:13,595 --> 00:15:16,734
She's a living person.

240
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,149
And there's a dead
little girl here, as well.

241
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:25,730
I know she was murdered by
the dark thing, the stalker.

242
00:15:27,207 --> 00:15:29,387
She's here to warn the living about him.

243
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:33,024
Do you know if the living girl has
had any experiences with the stalker?

244
00:15:33,025 --> 00:15:35,546
I think so, yes.

245
00:15:35,547 --> 00:15:38,877
I think she might have dreams.

246
00:15:38,878 --> 00:15:44,096
I don't know if he's [Bleep] around
with her in her nightmares or if she's...

247
00:15:44,097 --> 00:15:48,717
Woken up and seeing
something in her room.

248
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:55,429
He's really good at what
he does, which is watching.

249
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:57,484
But he's also dangerous?

250
00:15:57,485 --> 00:15:59,171
Oh, yeah.

251
00:15:59,172 --> 00:16:02,451
I think he killed the dead girl.

252
00:16:02,452 --> 00:16:06,892
And I think he wants to kill this girl.

253
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:20,412
I'm at the local library

254
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:25,536
to see what else I can uncover
about my client's property.

255
00:16:25,537 --> 00:16:27,045
Searching through old deeds,

256
00:16:27,046 --> 00:16:31,642
I discovered the original owner
was a guy named James Lanfear.

257
00:16:31,643 --> 00:16:35,039
But what really catches my eye
is an article about his wife...

258
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,500
Who died of a pulmonary
disease when she was only 25.

259
00:16:40,842 --> 00:16:44,112
Now that I know a 25-year-old woman
died on the property I'm investigating,

260
00:16:44,113 --> 00:16:46,224
I need to find out what happened.

261
00:16:46,225 --> 00:16:49,354
So I reached out to a local
historian who told me her death

262
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:55,255
was just the beginning of a long,
tragic story for the Lanfear family.

263
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:05,895
Mary Lanfear lived on the
property that you're investigating.

264
00:17:05,896 --> 00:17:10,048
She and her husband, James,
had two children, Ella and Cora.

265
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:10,957
Okay.

266
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:15,900
He was a farmer and a manufacturer,
and they were pretty well-to-do.

267
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:19,356
Okay. It sounds like she
died from a pulmonary disease.

268
00:17:19,357 --> 00:17:22,974
Tuberculosis. It was a
very painful way to go.

269
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:26,357
So, now, what happens to James
after his wife dies with two kids?

270
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:31,228
Strangely enough, five months
later, James remarried...

271
00:17:31,229 --> 00:17:32,985
A woman by the name of Harriet.

272
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:37,285
This is an announcement of the marriage.

273
00:17:37,286 --> 00:17:39,187
- Five months later?
- Yes.

274
00:17:39,188 --> 00:17:42,180
- He didn't waste much time, did he?
- Maybe he knew her. We don't know.

275
00:17:42,181 --> 00:17:44,661
So, he had two kids
with his wife who passed.

276
00:17:44,662 --> 00:17:46,859
Now he gets remarried. Does
he have any kids with her?

277
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,105
Unfortunately, both of their
children died, two little boys.

278
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:54,874
The first one died on
the day he was born.

279
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:58,300
And the next one was
stillborn, very sad.

280
00:17:58,301 --> 00:18:00,741
You know, Susan, this guy didn't
have an easy go with things.

281
00:18:00,742 --> 00:18:02,515
I mean, he loses his young wife.

282
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:06,485
Then he remarries and loses two kids it
looks like within a year of each other.

283
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:08,981
And then it gets worse.

284
00:18:08,982 --> 00:18:11,118
The next year, in 1860...

285
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:14,291
James and Harriet were
charged with child abuse.

286
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:17,000
- Child abuse?
- Yes.

287
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:18,681
Do you know any details about that case?

288
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:24,582
All I know is that it was quite a scandal
in Manchester, and it did go to trial.

289
00:18:25,936 --> 00:18:30,496
The stalker has, like,
an ease about him.

290
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:35,791
Do you have any idea about his life?

291
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,520
He's, like, really quiet,
and he's always watching.

292
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:47,767
He goes all over the house, so
I'm thinking that he lived here.

293
00:18:47,768 --> 00:18:50,960
What does he want to do to the living?

294
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:55,907
Well, with the women
here, he wants to kill 'em.

295
00:18:55,908 --> 00:18:58,461
Look, I'm no expert
on 19th-century law.

296
00:18:58,462 --> 00:19:02,002
But for someone to get charged with
a child abuse case back in the 1860s,

297
00:19:02,003 --> 00:19:04,095
it had to be pretty bad.

298
00:19:04,096 --> 00:19:06,558
I'm on my way to meet with
a retired police sergeant

299
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,299
who's done a lot of
research on this case.

300
00:19:16,654 --> 00:19:18,888
John, thanks for meeting me.

301
00:19:18,889 --> 00:19:20,731
- James and Harriet Lanfear.
- Mm hmm.

302
00:19:20,732 --> 00:19:24,029
They got brought up on charges of child
abuse, so what were you able to find out?

303
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:29,065
I was lucky enough to get one article
from a newspaper that mentioned it.

304
00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:30,936
John, let me ask you a
question. This is 1860.

305
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:33,788
Were a lot of cases
even brought to trial?

306
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:36,488
This is unheard of.
It just doesn't happen.

307
00:19:36,489 --> 00:19:40,686
And to make it even more interesting is
the people who's bringing the complaint.

308
00:19:40,687 --> 00:19:43,138
It's his own family.

309
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:46,007
This is a very
well-respected family in town.

310
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:48,014
This is a time period where,

311
00:19:48,015 --> 00:19:51,583
everybody's family business
was their own and no one else's.

312
00:19:51,584 --> 00:19:53,725
So the abuse had to
have been horrendous.

313
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,657
All right, so...

314
00:19:55,658 --> 00:20:00,558
She got a severe whipping and
application of a hot flatiron.

315
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,248
On one of the child's
limbs. That's pretty bad.

316
00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:05,679
Do you think the fact that she
was a female and 10 years old

317
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,757
is the reason that the case
was brought against him?

318
00:20:08,758 --> 00:20:12,467
I think it was the iron. That
is not common, to burn a child.

319
00:20:12,468 --> 00:20:14,433
John, let me ask you.
What was their defense?

320
00:20:14,434 --> 00:20:19,440
Well, their defense was they were trying
to raise their children not to be stubborn.

321
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:21,622
So, now, what wound up
happening at the trial?

322
00:20:21,623 --> 00:20:25,583
In the trial, they were acquitted.

323
00:20:28,317 --> 00:20:30,237
Whoa.

324
00:20:30,384 --> 00:20:35,064
There are a lot of
issues with the stairs.

325
00:20:36,308 --> 00:20:39,728
This sneaky, stalker guy...

326
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:45,676
Wants to hurt women and
push them down the stairs.

327
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,890
He wants to harm females here.

328
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:57,298
On two occasions, I felt that from him.

329
00:21:01,683 --> 00:21:04,543
I kind of felt the urge to
throw myself down the stairs.

330
00:21:04,544 --> 00:21:08,744
Like, kind of made me feel that way.

331
00:21:23,352 --> 00:21:26,087
In my research, I also
came across another family

332
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:29,275
that lived on Tom and Joanna's
property, the Colemans.

333
00:21:29,276 --> 00:21:33,742
What struck me odd was how many
family members died at a young age.

334
00:21:33,743 --> 00:21:35,322
I managed to track down a descendent,

335
00:21:35,323 --> 00:21:41,143
who says his family suffered
more than death in that house.

336
00:21:48,982 --> 00:21:51,779
Dennis, thanks for meeting me,
but let me ask you a question.

337
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,514
Why here in this church?

338
00:21:53,515 --> 00:21:57,721
Thomas Coleman's whole life
revolved around this church.

339
00:21:57,722 --> 00:22:01,720
This church, okay. What's your
relationship to Thomas Coleman?

340
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:05,464
Thomas Coleman was the
uncle of my grandmother.

341
00:22:05,465 --> 00:22:08,195
Okay. Now, what can
you tell me about him?

342
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:13,437
He was an immigrant that came
from Derry, Ireland, in 1881.

343
00:22:13,438 --> 00:22:14,418
Okay.

344
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:20,319
And he was able to buy the land that
you're talking about from his father-in-law.

345
00:22:20,754 --> 00:22:23,675
Okay. Now, Dennis, what I
found interesting was that um,

346
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,501
there was a lot of deaths associated
with Thomas Coleman's family.

347
00:22:26,502 --> 00:22:31,717
There was. He had an infant
son in 1892 that died.

348
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:34,991
His wife died young of a heart attack.

349
00:22:34,992 --> 00:22:37,872
Okay. You mentioned on the
phone there was more than death,

350
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:39,503
as far as tragedy for this family.

351
00:22:39,504 --> 00:22:40,894
Yes.

352
00:22:40,895 --> 00:22:43,651
Thomas' oldest son, Thomas...

353
00:22:43,652 --> 00:22:46,010
Married his first cousin.

354
00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:50,937
And it was a rule of the church that
you did not marry your first cousin.

355
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:54,958
So, Thomas Senior disowned his son.

356
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,064
Wow. That's pretty sad.

357
00:22:57,065 --> 00:22:58,170
Yes.

358
00:22:58,171 --> 00:23:02,416
But Thomas also had children
that were very devoted to him.

359
00:23:02,417 --> 00:23:05,657
One of them was Edward.

360
00:23:06,108 --> 00:23:10,449
Edward was the apple
of his father's eye.

361
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:14,270
They were very close.
They were both firemen.

362
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:17,345
He was the next oldest son.

363
00:23:17,346 --> 00:23:22,158
But he also died at a
very young age of 43.

364
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,938
Wow. That's pretty tragic.

365
00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:27,228
It says "kidney failure".

366
00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:29,672
Kidney and heart failure.

367
00:23:29,673 --> 00:23:33,747
He suffered over the last
couple years of his life.

368
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:35,668
Okay.

369
00:23:46,028 --> 00:23:49,508
This guy in the basement...

370
00:23:53,069 --> 00:23:54,989
He...

371
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,250
Felt very, very ill.

372
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:02,547
The angry guy from the
basement has come out of hiding,

373
00:24:02,548 --> 00:24:04,494
and he wants me to feel his pain.

374
00:24:04,495 --> 00:24:07,863
The pain he felt when he was dying.

375
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:11,202
And it hurt, and it hurts, like, here.

376
00:24:11,203 --> 00:24:12,985
Really bad.

377
00:24:12,986 --> 00:24:18,266
Like, this is... he's
like... he's even like that.

378
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:26,086
Can you tell anything about
who he was when he was alive?

379
00:24:26,087 --> 00:24:29,267
I think he lived here.

380
00:24:29,447 --> 00:24:33,974
He was a pretty private
guy, pretty introverted.

381
00:24:33,975 --> 00:24:37,035
Seems pretty educated.

382
00:24:37,979 --> 00:24:41,039
Got sick in his 40s.

383
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,880
His life was met with
darkness and tragedy.

384
00:24:47,989 --> 00:24:50,749
Oh, this is bad.

385
00:25:02,937 --> 00:25:05,190
I'm having a sketch artist
draw the two entities

386
00:25:05,191 --> 00:25:07,550
who stood out the most from my walk.

387
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:11,031
First, the tough older man.

388
00:25:11,687 --> 00:25:14,747
He's white, heavyset.

389
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,953
He had gray hair...

390
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:20,537
That was receding back.

391
00:25:20,538 --> 00:25:22,363
Like a widow's peak.

392
00:25:22,364 --> 00:25:24,284
Okay.

393
00:25:26,328 --> 00:25:31,098
Next, I described the dark figure
I saw in the little girl's room.

394
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:34,017
She's probably like 5 or something.

395
00:25:34,018 --> 00:25:36,262
And she's in the bed.

396
00:25:36,263 --> 00:25:39,225
And then there's a little
girl here who's much younger.

397
00:25:39,226 --> 00:25:42,024
She's wearing a little dress.

398
00:25:42,025 --> 00:25:47,425
And there's, like, this
weird black thing behind her.

399
00:25:51,323 --> 00:25:54,443
Is that what you saw?

400
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:57,501
Yes.

401
00:26:21,342 --> 00:26:24,090
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations.

402
00:26:24,091 --> 00:26:28,494
We're ready to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

403
00:26:28,495 --> 00:26:30,984
Amy, I'd like you to
meet Tom and Joanna.

404
00:26:30,985 --> 00:26:32,762
They've been living
here about eight years.

405
00:26:32,763 --> 00:26:35,736
Tom is pretty anxious about
the stuff that's going on here.

406
00:26:35,737 --> 00:26:37,892
Joanna gets absolutely no sleep.

407
00:26:37,893 --> 00:26:41,595
The activity in this house is so
bad, it's actually tearing them apart.

408
00:26:41,596 --> 00:26:44,637
But their biggest concern is
their 8-year-old daughter, Allyson.

409
00:26:44,638 --> 00:26:47,933
Who's actually afraid to go
anywhere in this house alone.

410
00:26:47,934 --> 00:26:53,834
So, with that being said, I'm going to ask
Amy to tell us a little bit about her walk.

411
00:26:55,153 --> 00:27:00,433
When I walked into the
basement, I saw this entity.

412
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:04,519
He was very angry, depressed, and...

413
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,366
Apparently, he used to live here.

414
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:12,079
One of the things with him was the
pain I kept feeling in my stomach,

415
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,462
and it felt like an
illness, and I felt sick.

416
00:27:15,463 --> 00:27:19,388
It took a long time before he died.

417
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:21,715
Any idea how old this
guy might have been?

418
00:27:21,716 --> 00:27:24,596
- 45.
- Wow, okay.

419
00:27:25,021 --> 00:27:28,528
One guy that comes to mind for me that
actually lived in this property here,

420
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:30,973
was a guy by the name of Edward Coleman.

421
00:27:30,974 --> 00:27:33,169
He was a fireman.

422
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:37,010
I actually have a photo of him.

423
00:27:37,631 --> 00:27:40,773
He died in his early 40s.

424
00:27:40,774 --> 00:27:44,674
I got his death certificate here.

425
00:27:46,113 --> 00:27:49,982
He basically died from
kidney and heart failure.

426
00:27:49,983 --> 00:27:52,844
You mentioned pain in the stomach.

427
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:54,163
Mm-hmm.

428
00:27:54,164 --> 00:27:59,676
One of the symptoms of kidney failure
is a swelling of the stomach and cramps.

429
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:02,161
You know, you mentioned
that he was depressed.

430
00:28:02,162 --> 00:28:06,022
His older brother
married his first cousin.

431
00:28:06,023 --> 00:28:09,575
And it tore the family apart.

432
00:28:09,576 --> 00:28:14,440
What this person likes to
do is just be left alone.

433
00:28:14,441 --> 00:28:18,769
When he's not left
alone, he'll get upset.

434
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:22,724
The main place where he hangs
out is actually upstairs,

435
00:28:22,725 --> 00:28:26,925
by the bathroom and the office areas.

436
00:28:27,982 --> 00:28:33,742
There's a lot of problems
here, specifically in this area.

437
00:28:34,127 --> 00:28:39,616
I'm hearing, like, stuff sliding across
the floor, like hearing furniture moving.

438
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:42,857
He will really go nuts.

439
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:47,903
When we have to walk past what's
my office now, on two occasions,

440
00:28:47,904 --> 00:28:51,847
it sounded like something
heavy sliding across the desk.

441
00:28:51,848 --> 00:28:54,589
And I was too uncomfortable
with that room to begin with,

442
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:57,737
and I didn't want to open the door
and look, see what was going on.

443
00:28:57,738 --> 00:29:01,364
And why do you not like
that room to begin with?

444
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:05,158
It's just a very heavy feeling,
very oppressive feeling in that room.

445
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:07,788
It just physically
makes you uncomfortable.

446
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:12,589
This house just has a
lot of sadness to it.

447
00:29:15,095 --> 00:29:16,568
What else did you see?

448
00:29:16,569 --> 00:29:19,271
I met this other man.

449
00:29:19,272 --> 00:29:22,078
He was in his 60s.

450
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:27,979
Uh, he was, like, a stocky guy, and
he was, like, a tough guy, like a cop.

451
00:29:27,986 --> 00:29:32,799
He was constantly on patrol,
and he had a short temper.

452
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,472
He is somebody who recently
died within the last 20 years.

453
00:29:37,473 --> 00:29:43,373
I felt like he was a father, a
grandfather to somebody who lives here.

454
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:50,914
I don't know if he's alive or
not, but my father was a cop,

455
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:56,815
and he had a temper, and one time, he
will take gun and put to my mom's head.

456
00:29:57,722 --> 00:30:01,601
And he would say that
"I teach you lesson".

457
00:30:01,602 --> 00:30:03,604
Or something like that.

458
00:30:03,605 --> 00:30:08,538
He didn't use it, but
I saw him being capable.

459
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:10,955
I tried looking into
Joanna's father's history,

460
00:30:10,956 --> 00:30:13,773
but she hadn't spoken to
him in almost 30 years.

461
00:30:13,774 --> 00:30:16,128
And KGB records are
pretty hard to come by.

462
00:30:16,129 --> 00:30:19,398
So, unfortunately, I couldn't
confirm if he's alive or dead.

463
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:25,299
I didn't think I was gonna need it,
but I have the photo of your father.

464
00:30:26,673 --> 00:30:29,608
That's Joanna, and that's
her father right there.

465
00:30:29,609 --> 00:30:32,048
Could that be him?

466
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:35,529
I did do a sketch of him.

467
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,580
Wow.

468
00:30:42,689 --> 00:30:45,989
Looks pretty good to me.

469
00:31:11,048 --> 00:31:15,848
So, he's not the kind of guy
that we'd want to see around here.

470
00:31:18,935 --> 00:31:20,459
Trying to protect.

471
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:24,569
Given their traumatic relationship,
I'm not surprised Joanna's dad is here.

472
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:27,372
The dead don't just form
attachments to locations

473
00:31:27,373 --> 00:31:30,236
but to the people who are
the most important to them.

474
00:31:30,237 --> 00:31:32,151
What is he protecting?

475
00:31:32,152 --> 00:31:34,905
I mean, he never
protected me as a child.

476
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:39,352
I did feel a lot of
conflicting emotions from him.

477
00:31:39,353 --> 00:31:40,937
Guilt?

478
00:31:40,938 --> 00:31:43,976
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

479
00:31:43,977 --> 00:31:49,497
But he's not happy with the
choices you made in life.

480
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:53,449
Also, I felt that he
could influence moods.

481
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:58,330
He has very strong emotions,
and you can feel them.

482
00:31:58,331 --> 00:32:01,095
You will feel that anger for no reason,

483
00:32:01,096 --> 00:32:06,996
or feel a sense of dissatisfaction
with your life for no reason.

484
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:10,970
Do you guys ever feel that way?

485
00:32:13,737 --> 00:32:17,757
I used to be a much gentler soul.

486
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:21,623
Since we've lived here,
I'm much more explosive...

487
00:32:21,624 --> 00:32:24,550
And moody and angry.

488
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:26,318
Now, was he like that in life?

489
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,510
Yeah, he never was
satisfied with anything...

490
00:32:30,511 --> 00:32:34,851
Having enough, owning
enough, hurting enough.

491
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:38,212
And then, angry about it.

492
00:32:38,688 --> 00:32:43,382
To me, to think that it would be someone
like him here makes me really angry.

493
00:32:43,383 --> 00:32:48,423
There might be a definite
reason why he's here.

494
00:32:49,974 --> 00:32:53,034
I saw an entity I...

495
00:32:53,516 --> 00:32:55,908
Was afraid of.

496
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:57,991
He might have lived here.

497
00:32:57,992 --> 00:33:03,296
I felt that this entity was
dangerous and all over this house.

498
00:33:03,297 --> 00:33:06,671
The problem with him
is that he doesn't...

499
00:33:06,672 --> 00:33:08,623
Have boundaries.

500
00:33:08,624 --> 00:33:10,828
He also...

501
00:33:10,829 --> 00:33:13,021
Hates women, uh...

502
00:33:13,022 --> 00:33:15,731
When he was alive, he did harm them.

503
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:19,632
Both grown women and young women.

504
00:33:21,151 --> 00:33:25,622
You know, you mentioned the
guy you saw liked to hurt girls.

505
00:33:25,623 --> 00:33:27,488
Let me tell you about
this guy, James Lanfear.

506
00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:32,052
He lived on the property here
back in 1850s into the 1860s.

507
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:37,953
He and his wife went on trial for severely
beating their 10-year-old daughter...

508
00:33:38,259 --> 00:33:43,419
Which I have an article
here that talks about it.

509
00:33:45,469 --> 00:33:50,370
Now, it was so bad that his own
family members turned them in.

510
00:33:50,371 --> 00:33:54,227
I'm not making excuses for the
guy, but he did have a tough life.

511
00:33:54,228 --> 00:33:57,810
He did lose two infant
kids at childbirth.

512
00:33:57,811 --> 00:33:59,590
He lost his first wife.

513
00:33:59,591 --> 00:34:03,891
She dies from Tuberculosis
at the age of 25.

514
00:34:03,892 --> 00:34:06,000
Did you get anything
else on this guy at all?

515
00:34:06,001 --> 00:34:09,781
He has extremely bad intentions.

516
00:34:10,147 --> 00:34:13,587
I was watching through
the eyes of a little girl,

517
00:34:13,588 --> 00:34:17,908
that he was stalking and then murdered.

518
00:34:18,175 --> 00:34:20,170
I mean, I got no proof of any of that.

519
00:34:20,171 --> 00:34:23,776
But don't forget,
mid-1800s, how hard is it to

520
00:34:23,777 --> 00:34:26,738
chase somebody down, kill 'em, bury 'em?

521
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:28,980
This is a pretty isolated part of town.

522
00:34:28,981 --> 00:34:31,295
Really isolated.

523
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:35,106
He was so filled with negativity
that he is turning into,

524
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:38,527
kind of like a dark mass.

525
00:34:40,342 --> 00:34:43,387
And I think that's how people see him.

526
00:34:43,388 --> 00:34:45,458
He's just evil.

527
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:48,564
Now, you saw the shadow figure in
your daughter's playroom, right?

528
00:34:48,565 --> 00:34:51,587
Yeah, I was in the closet
painting, facing out to the room,

529
00:34:51,588 --> 00:34:57,488
and I just looked up, and I saw
a black mass moving down the wall.

530
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:03,460
That was disturbing, I had
never seen that here before.

531
00:35:03,461 --> 00:35:05,408
Do you think it's this guy?

532
00:35:05,409 --> 00:35:06,962
More than likely.

533
00:35:06,963 --> 00:35:10,386
I did do a sketch of something that I...

534
00:35:10,387 --> 00:35:12,847
Saw upstairs.

535
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,256
Can you describe what's
going on in this sketch?

536
00:35:31,257 --> 00:35:34,377
That's their daughter.

537
00:35:34,874 --> 00:35:36,392
Okay, so, who's this kid?

538
00:35:36,393 --> 00:35:40,669
This is the little
girl that he murdered.

539
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:44,224
So, the shadow he saw
is probably this guy?

540
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,019
Yeah, I think so.

541
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,319
I saw the exact same thing.

542
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,220
No arms, no limbs, just a shape.

543
00:35:52,356 --> 00:35:56,394
With a pronounced area
where the head would be.

544
00:35:56,395 --> 00:36:01,882
I didn't see it, but the night
that I slept with my daughter,

545
00:36:01,883 --> 00:36:06,863
around midnight, somebody
just touch my shoulder.

546
00:36:09,008 --> 00:36:12,433
Let me show you a picture
of the reason we're here.

547
00:36:12,434 --> 00:36:14,882
This is Allyson.

548
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:16,048
- Mm.
- All right?

549
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,077
Mm-hmm.

550
00:36:17,078 --> 00:36:19,066
She always had said that,

551
00:36:19,067 --> 00:36:22,471
you know, something is standing at
the foot of her bed when she sleeps.

552
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:26,593
She's always been frightened up
there, and she had said that, you know,

553
00:36:26,594 --> 00:36:29,891
"sometimes a man will come
stand at the foot of my bed,

554
00:36:29,892 --> 00:36:33,225
sometimes a woman,
and sometimes a child".

555
00:36:33,226 --> 00:36:37,635
Do me a favor. Just tell her about
the two kids when you were in the bed.

556
00:36:37,636 --> 00:36:39,403
Tell her about that incident.

557
00:36:39,404 --> 00:36:43,812
One night, I went to bed, and I
turned to my left towards the door,

558
00:36:43,813 --> 00:36:49,392
and there's two apparitions of two
girls standing right next to the bed.

559
00:36:49,393 --> 00:36:55,019
And they were wearing old-fashioned
dress, almost like calico and lace collars.

560
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:55,917
Wow.

561
00:36:55,918 --> 00:37:00,063
So, why would they come
to me and my daughter?

562
00:37:00,064 --> 00:37:05,884
His victims are coming to her
to try to warn her and you.

563
00:37:06,723 --> 00:37:09,619
I am very nervous about this man.

564
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:13,571
He's very dark and
capable of very bad things.

565
00:37:13,572 --> 00:37:17,805
He wants to continue doing
what he started doing in life.

566
00:37:17,806 --> 00:37:21,286
His intentions are to kill.

567
00:37:21,734 --> 00:37:25,154
Who's he looking to kill?

568
00:37:27,101 --> 00:37:29,621
Your daughter.

569
00:37:41,031 --> 00:37:44,174
I am very nervous about this man.

570
00:37:44,175 --> 00:37:50,047
He's very dark, and he is very
capable of very bad things.

571
00:37:50,048 --> 00:37:55,098
He wants to continue doing
what he started doing in life.

572
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:57,741
His intentions are to kill.

573
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:01,222
Who is he looking to kill?

574
00:38:01,926 --> 00:38:04,446
Your daughter.

575
00:38:07,857 --> 00:38:11,372
You have this person,
who is a sociopath.

576
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:14,932
And he is stalking his prey.

577
00:38:14,933 --> 00:38:17,441
So, he is excited.

578
00:38:17,442 --> 00:38:19,842
He's happy.

579
00:38:23,614 --> 00:38:27,991
- Can it hurt Allyson or anybody else?
- Yes. I think so, yes.

580
00:38:27,992 --> 00:38:31,988
So, you think it's just a matter
of time before something happens?

581
00:38:31,989 --> 00:38:34,329
Yes, I do.

582
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:37,550
We got a problem here.

583
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:42,745
Well, I realize this was a
tough night for you guys and,

584
00:38:42,746 --> 00:38:45,135
some upsetting news that
you weren't expecting.

585
00:38:45,136 --> 00:38:48,138
But we still haven't answered
your most pressing question.

586
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:50,273
Is it safe for Allyson to grow up here?

587
00:38:50,274 --> 00:38:56,016
So, for that, I'm gonna turn it over to my
partner, Amy, and see what she has to say.

588
00:38:56,017 --> 00:38:59,163
One of the things that occurred to me

589
00:38:59,164 --> 00:39:03,481
after the investigation
was the possibility that...

590
00:39:03,482 --> 00:39:07,322
Allyson is a very strong medium.

591
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:13,232
She may have attracted...

592
00:39:13,233 --> 00:39:15,993
This guy to her.

593
00:39:16,517 --> 00:39:19,489
And because she's...

594
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,386
The type of person...

595
00:39:22,387 --> 00:39:26,536
That he, in life, may have stalked...

596
00:39:26,537 --> 00:39:29,777
He is now stalking her.

597
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:34,576
It's not her fault. It's
just something she has.

598
00:39:34,577 --> 00:39:36,686
What's your religion?

599
00:39:36,687 --> 00:39:39,523
I'm an ordained minister,
non-denominational.

600
00:39:39,524 --> 00:39:43,860
One of the things that I
would like to see happen is...

601
00:39:43,861 --> 00:39:48,162
For you and your daughter
to go to your church,

602
00:39:48,163 --> 00:39:51,703
and to talk to your pastor.

603
00:39:52,436 --> 00:39:58,336
Because you do need to have an
exorcist perform a ritual to remove him.

604
00:40:02,435 --> 00:40:07,484
Because he is so evil and
because he is so strong.

605
00:40:07,485 --> 00:40:10,882
Once that's done and he's kicked out.

606
00:40:10,883 --> 00:40:16,548
It's very likely that all of the victims
will leave, because their job is done.

607
00:40:16,549 --> 00:40:18,893
So, will the exorcism
get rid of the fireman?

608
00:40:18,894 --> 00:40:23,187
No. So, here's what you would need
to do to get rid of the fireman.

609
00:40:23,188 --> 00:40:25,480
Perform the real basic cleansing.

610
00:40:25,481 --> 00:40:28,545
While you're doing the cleansing,
you're telling him to leave.

611
00:40:28,546 --> 00:40:30,616
He's not welcomed. He's not wanted.

612
00:40:30,617 --> 00:40:34,382
Through the entire house,
from the basement to the attic.

613
00:40:34,383 --> 00:40:36,300
What about Joanna's dad?

614
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:41,693
One thing that I would ask you to do
is to write a letter to your father.

615
00:40:41,694 --> 00:40:46,829
About everything, how you felt he treated
you, how you felt he treated your mother,

616
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:49,564
the things you saw,
how it made you feel.

617
00:40:49,565 --> 00:40:54,605
Then one night, while you're
alone in the house, read it.

618
00:40:54,606 --> 00:40:59,285
And then at the end, tell him
to now leave you alone in peace.

619
00:41:02,678 --> 00:41:07,549
I just feel very helpless
through the whole thing, you know?

620
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,963
I feel that if my
faith was stronger that,

621
00:41:10,964 --> 00:41:14,822
maybe some of this would
not be the way it is.

622
00:41:14,823 --> 00:41:18,393
I just feel my way is lost a little bit.

623
00:41:18,394 --> 00:41:21,979
In this situation, you
need to help your daughter.

624
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:26,496
And it sucks that you
feel the way you do, but...

625
00:41:26,497 --> 00:41:31,745
As a man of this home and this
family, you have to buck up.

626
00:41:31,746 --> 00:41:34,525
You got to be strong for your daughter.

627
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:39,926
You need to help her and
your wife get through this.

628
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,612
There is love here.

629
00:41:42,613 --> 00:41:46,254
That's your faith.
That's your motivator.

630
00:41:46,255 --> 00:41:48,175
Yeah.

631
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:51,647
I believe it.

632
00:41:51,648 --> 00:41:53,995
I understand Tom and Joanna's fears.

633
00:41:53,996 --> 00:41:57,699
When you're dealing with such a
dangerous entity, it's terrifying.

634
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,813
But I believe if they follow my advice,

635
00:41:59,814 --> 00:42:05,623
they can protect Allyson and themselves
from the evil inside their home.
