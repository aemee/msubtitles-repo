1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:10,884 --> 00:00:14,654
There is a lot of
sadness and a lot of fear.

3
00:00:14,655 --> 00:00:16,289
It scares me.

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,327
There is something in this
house that I can't see.

5
00:00:20,328 --> 00:00:22,476
I was pulled into the closet.

6
00:00:22,477 --> 00:00:25,398
They get pissed. They attack.

7
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:27,298
I have definitely stirred things up.

8
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:28,440
Amy's not gonna like that.

9
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:30,876
It's kind of demented.

10
00:00:30,877 --> 00:00:35,617
They're trying to get
out, and they can't.

11
00:00:35,642 --> 00:00:37,874
They're being watched.

12
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:40,995
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:41,045 --> 00:00:43,046
This thing likes death.

14
00:00:43,047 --> 00:00:44,781
I see dead people.

15
00:00:44,782 --> 00:00:46,416
This thing's, like, a monster.

16
00:00:46,417 --> 00:00:48,452
I speak to dead people.

17
00:00:48,453 --> 00:00:49,986
And he's pissed off now.

18
00:00:49,987 --> 00:00:51,655
And they speak to me.

19
00:00:51,656 --> 00:00:53,274
His head was cracked.

20
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:56,793
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

21
00:00:56,794 --> 00:00:58,283
This guy was murdered.

22
00:00:58,284 --> 00:00:59,755
I rely on my partner.

23
00:00:59,756 --> 00:01:03,166
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

24
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:05,702
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

25
00:01:05,703 --> 00:01:09,038
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

26
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,474
You saw her?

27
00:01:10,475 --> 00:01:11,708
It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:12,985
Why would you stay here?

29
00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:15,211
But Steve and I never speak...

30
00:01:15,212 --> 00:01:17,147
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:17,148 --> 00:01:18,515
Until the very end.

32
00:01:18,516 --> 00:01:20,350
Stop it.

33
00:01:20,351 --> 00:01:22,233
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

34
00:01:22,234 --> 00:01:24,821
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

35
00:01:24,822 --> 00:01:26,122
Or time to get out.

36
00:01:26,123 --> 00:01:30,863
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

37
00:01:42,573 --> 00:01:45,239
As a former Detective, I
know most cases can be solved,

38
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,796
if you know where to look.

39
00:01:47,797 --> 00:01:52,147
That's why I look into the location's dark
history and interview living witnesses.

40
00:01:52,148 --> 00:01:56,288
While Amy communicates with the dead.

41
00:01:57,455 --> 00:01:59,389
This is an interesting case.

42
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,826
I did some homework, and I'm kind of
suspicious of our client's motives.

43
00:02:02,827 --> 00:02:07,897
So I'm not willing to disclose exactly
where I am until I find out more.

44
00:02:07,898 --> 00:02:11,004
I got a call from a guy named
Todd, who's a single dad.

45
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:14,471
He went and bought this mansion in
hopes of turning it into a hotel...

46
00:02:14,472 --> 00:02:18,659
But he says things there are out of
control, and he thinks it's not safe.

47
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,587
Worst of all, he thinks it's his fault.

48
00:02:21,588 --> 00:02:24,548
He still deserves an
honest investigation.

49
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:30,449
At least until I can find out
what his exact intentions are.

50
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:39,896
Before Amy arrives, I have to clear
the area of any leading information.

51
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:41,470
This house doesn't look lived in,

52
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:46,896
but it's still important that I remove
anything that could influence her findings.

53
00:02:46,897 --> 00:02:52,797
When I'm done, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

54
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:21,834
There's a lot of people
here, and they're sick.

55
00:03:22,473 --> 00:03:24,648
None of 'em are thinking right.

56
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:27,764
It's overwhelming me because
they're all kind of, like, coming.

57
00:03:27,765 --> 00:03:31,665
I'm very nervous to go upstairs.

58
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:37,454
I feel very uncomfortable about that.

59
00:03:37,455 --> 00:03:40,155
It's disturbing.

60
00:03:53,264 --> 00:03:55,305
Todd, when I spoke to you on the phone,

61
00:03:55,306 --> 00:03:57,507
you sounded like you were
in a pretty bad place.

62
00:03:57,508 --> 00:03:59,008
What's going on in this house?

63
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:03,450
I want to make this into a hotel and
be able to pass this down to my son.

64
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,056
So, what's stopping you?

65
00:04:05,057 --> 00:04:07,922
There's just so much
activity in this house.

66
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:12,327
We hear people's footsteps.
We can see apparitions.

67
00:04:12,328 --> 00:04:14,207
People are being physically touched.

68
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,330
Hanging around the neighborhood
and talking to people,

69
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:18,780
they told me that you turned
this place into a haunted house.

70
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:20,168
So, what's the story with that?

71
00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:24,136
Well, during the Halloween season, I
would open up as a Halloween attraction.

72
00:04:24,137 --> 00:04:26,125
I ran that for eight years,

73
00:04:26,126 --> 00:04:30,505
and around approximately 30,000
people came through every October.

74
00:04:30,506 --> 00:04:32,732
I could tell you right now,
Amy's not gonna like that.

75
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:36,669
- No?
- Because you're exploiting the dead.

76
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,319
I believe Todd's story,

77
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,544
but he's also making money off of what's
going on here, so he's got a conflict.

78
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:43,906
I've seen this happen before,

79
00:04:43,907 --> 00:04:47,257
and it never ends well for these
guys once Amy does her walk.

80
00:04:47,258 --> 00:04:51,668
I believe over these years, I
have definitely stirred things up.

81
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:57,569
Beyond a reasonable doubt, there is
something in this house that I can't see.

82
00:05:00,651 --> 00:05:01,966
Ugh.

83
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:06,580
I just feel people freaking
themselves out constantly.

84
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:10,833
It's this thing that
living people left here.

85
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:13,354
Residual fear.

86
00:05:15,914 --> 00:05:19,884
You're, like, oh, oh, God.
Oh, God, I'm so scared.

87
00:05:19,885 --> 00:05:22,973
But it's not... it's not real.

88
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:27,087
They're showing me people who are
alive, and they're laughing at them.

89
00:05:27,088 --> 00:05:30,098
Like, they're just
like, this is ridiculous.

90
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:34,899
- The dead are laughing at the living?
- Yes.

91
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,408
Todd, why'd you bring me
up here? What's going on?

92
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,376
There's been a lot of
groups come through here,

93
00:05:45,377 --> 00:05:49,418
exploring and investigating,
doing their EVP sessions.

94
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:51,148
So, how many groups
are we talking about?

95
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:54,270
I would say approximately
maybe 100 groups.

96
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,085
100?

97
00:05:55,086 --> 00:05:58,904
Yeah, over all these years, they've
come in and done their investigation.

98
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:00,801
You still continue to
have people come in?

99
00:06:00,802 --> 00:06:03,431
No, there's no more
investigating whatsoever.

100
00:06:03,432 --> 00:06:06,718
- And when did that stop?
- Probably about two years ago.

101
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:09,336
From what the city says,
the building is unsafe.

102
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:14,197
It's just been sitting
here vacant by itself.

103
00:06:23,994 --> 00:06:26,485
It seems to me that...

104
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:31,590
The living have put more
negativity into this place,

105
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:34,171
than the dead.

106
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:40,074
A lot of stuff has been cleaned here.

107
00:06:40,075 --> 00:06:41,592
You mean, like, entities?

108
00:06:41,593 --> 00:06:45,253
Mm-hmm. It's, like, psychics.

109
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:49,477
And people trying to talk to them
all the time and things like that.

110
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:51,578
They think it's...

111
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:53,592
[Bleep] Up.

112
00:06:53,593 --> 00:06:57,218
When I come in, I say, just let me
know what you want people to know.

113
00:06:57,219 --> 00:06:59,090
This is all they want people to know.

114
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:03,051
This is [Bleep] up. This is sick.

115
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:06,827
Anything else in this room?

116
00:07:06,828 --> 00:07:09,434
- I was decorating this wall right here.
- Okay.

117
00:07:09,435 --> 00:07:10,963
Out of my peripheral vision,

118
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:14,535
I could see a full-figured black
entity standing at this doorway.

119
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:16,018
- This one here?
- Yes.

120
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:19,570
And within a second, it rushed me.

121
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:23,212
It just came from that
doorway straight up to me.

122
00:07:23,213 --> 00:07:26,981
I jumped, I screamed, and it was gone.

123
00:07:26,982 --> 00:07:29,065
You got a lot of traffic
out in front of this place.

124
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:31,742
You sure it couldn't have been,
like, a light reflecting something,

125
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,022
and then, as it moved,
it came towards you?

126
00:07:34,023 --> 00:07:37,574
I have never been more sure of anything.

127
00:07:37,575 --> 00:07:41,236
That it was that black figure,
and it came right up to me.

128
00:07:41,237 --> 00:07:44,117
That frightened me.

129
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:52,320
I think people have
had experiences in here.

130
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:54,471
Do the dead interact with them at all?

131
00:07:54,472 --> 00:07:57,232
Yes. They attack.

132
00:07:58,123 --> 00:08:00,826
The dead here are fed up
with people harassing them.

133
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:04,596
Now they're fighting back, trying to
force the living out of their space.

134
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:07,297
They get pissed.

135
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,637
And they will...

136
00:08:09,638 --> 00:08:12,405
You know, really jump on the living.

137
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:14,033
So, what do they do?

138
00:08:14,034 --> 00:08:19,934
Pushing, they try to be very physical
and push the living people out of there.

139
00:08:22,448 --> 00:08:27,051
I think it's really important that you
know that this used to be the Sanitarium.

140
00:08:27,052 --> 00:08:29,147
What kind of patients we talking about?

141
00:08:29,148 --> 00:08:32,524
- Mentally ill patients stayed here.
- Did they leave any records behind?

142
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:36,077
They did. Up on the fourth floor. You
are more than welcome to go through 'em.

143
00:08:36,078 --> 00:08:37,098
Okay.

144
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:41,085
And over here is where
the hospital wing was.

145
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:42,491
It was a wing?

146
00:08:42,492 --> 00:08:46,245
There was a 10,000-square-foot wing
right here that housed 17 bedrooms.

147
00:08:46,246 --> 00:08:48,742
So, what happened to it?

148
00:08:48,743 --> 00:08:50,550
I demolished it all.

149
00:08:50,551 --> 00:08:52,765
Okay, now, did you have
an experience in there?

150
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,769
Yes. When I was in the hospital wing,

151
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,901
getting ready to open up
for the Halloween attraction,

152
00:08:56,902 --> 00:09:01,470
something came up behind me and
physically touched me on my lower back.

153
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:03,086
It felt like a human hand.

154
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:05,889
And I turned around quickly to see
if someone else needed my attention,

155
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,010
and no one was there.

156
00:09:13,347 --> 00:09:18,618
I think there were a lot of
people here who were mentally ill.

157
00:09:18,619 --> 00:09:23,719
It just kind of creeped me out because
it's, like, they can't communicate, really.

158
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,173
They just look...

159
00:09:26,174 --> 00:09:28,154
Weird.

160
00:09:31,514 --> 00:09:35,994
Either way drugged out, so
it made them, like, be like...

161
00:09:35,995 --> 00:09:41,454
No, I really think that they
were nuts because of how they...

162
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,343
Are moving.

163
00:09:43,344 --> 00:09:44,777
How do they move?

164
00:09:44,778 --> 00:09:50,678
Just, you know, you have, like, the
ones who are crawling on the walls.

165
00:09:52,822 --> 00:09:56,062
Ooh, I don't like 'em.

166
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:20,899
So, Glenda, thanks for meeting me here,
but it seems like you're a little...

167
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,977
Uneasy being in the house.

168
00:10:22,978 --> 00:10:24,585
Mm-hmm, yes, I am.

169
00:10:24,586 --> 00:10:27,148
I just get the shakes
every time I come in here.

170
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:31,485
One of my friends, when she
came here, got violently ill.

171
00:10:31,486 --> 00:10:33,587
It was like she was
having a heart attack.

172
00:10:33,588 --> 00:10:36,690
As a matter of fact, she went
to the hospital for three days.

173
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:37,992
What was wrong with her?

174
00:10:37,993 --> 00:10:41,595
To this day, six years later,
they still haven't figured it out.

175
00:10:41,596 --> 00:10:43,654
Okay, have you had experiences?

176
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:44,899
Yes.

177
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:49,564
We were in one of the rooms upstairs,
and I got touched right here.

178
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:55,246
And then, just a few minutes later,
they started touching my head, hard.

179
00:10:55,247 --> 00:10:56,958
Okay, what did you do?

180
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,239
I ran into the other room and just
stayed put for the rest of the night.

181
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,969
- I wouldn't go anywhere else.
- Now, let me ask you a question.

182
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,891
The night this stuff
happened you sure nobody was

183
00:11:05,892 --> 00:11:07,740
messing around with you
being that it was dark?

184
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:09,891
No, there was nobody around me.

185
00:11:09,892 --> 00:11:11,214
- At all?
- No.

186
00:11:11,215 --> 00:11:15,145
Pretty much since that night, every
time I come in here, I get touched.

187
00:11:15,146 --> 00:11:17,666
It scares me.

188
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:24,557
I don't particularly like it down here,

189
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:27,918
because the dead people...

190
00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:31,669
Hang out down here a lot.

191
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,774
There is a man who's very agitated.

192
00:11:36,775 --> 00:11:39,172
So I think he could actually
be pretty aggressive,

193
00:11:39,173 --> 00:11:41,900
as far as trying to
reach out and get help.

194
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:45,484
In life, when they were locked
down here, trying to get out,

195
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:50,225
they're trying to get
out, and they can't.

196
00:11:51,414 --> 00:11:54,294
It's very chaotic.

197
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:57,535
Just hearing the movement,
scratching on the walls,

198
00:11:57,536 --> 00:11:59,975
screaming, banging on the
walls, trying to get out.

199
00:11:59,976 --> 00:12:02,856
Like, those noises.

200
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:08,169
I don't like it at all.

201
00:12:08,446 --> 00:12:11,287
What do you think about
Todd owning this place?

202
00:12:11,288 --> 00:12:14,850
At first when he bought it,
I encouraged him, you know?

203
00:12:14,851 --> 00:12:17,386
Oh, my gosh, it's like a
gold mine type of thing.

204
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:20,040
You know, he was doing
the Halloween attraction.

205
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:23,426
And then as things start
happening, and I see things,

206
00:12:23,427 --> 00:12:26,123
and I feel things, I'm
like, I'd get rid of it.

207
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:28,606
What do you think your brother
should be doing with this house?

208
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:32,284
Bulldoze it down, and then... I
mean, it's on commercial property.

209
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:33,752
Do something else.

210
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,728
Let me ask you a question. Would
you stay here overnight alone?

211
00:12:36,729 --> 00:12:39,423
- Absolutely not.
- Okay.

212
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:41,426
I will never stay here again.

213
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,362
I will not shut my eyes in this home.

214
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:47,499
Something here has been getting
physical with people inside the mansion.

215
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,790
So I've reached out to one
of Todd's former employees,

216
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,252
from when this place was
a Halloween attraction,

217
00:12:52,253 --> 00:12:58,013
who says she had a terrifying
experience while on the job.

218
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:03,345
Laura, I understand that you
actually used to work here.

219
00:13:03,346 --> 00:13:06,545
Yes. I would just pop
out and scare people.

220
00:13:06,546 --> 00:13:09,511
Laura, Todd told me that you
had a pretty bad experience here.

221
00:13:09,512 --> 00:13:11,046
Why don't you tell me about it?

222
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:16,277
I was standing here in this closet
wearing a black cloak to not be seen.

223
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:20,893
And before we opened the
house, I was pulled back,

224
00:13:20,894 --> 00:13:23,600
into the closet, like,
hands grabbing me.

225
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:24,997
And I had to jiggle away.

226
00:13:24,998 --> 00:13:28,939
I turned on my flashlight to make sure that
I didn't get caught on a nail or anything.

227
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,837
- Okay.
- And I...

228
00:13:30,838 --> 00:13:34,008
So I just kind of tugged
away and ran out of here.

229
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:36,995
Okay so you looked behind you with the
flashlight, you didn't see anything?

230
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:38,330
Didn't see anything.

231
00:13:38,331 --> 00:13:40,697
And anybody else couldn't have
been in the closet with you?

232
00:13:40,698 --> 00:13:42,299
No.

233
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:48,200
When I ran out, my boss said that,
you look like you saw a ghost.

234
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:52,141
And he goes, well, what are you doing?
Go back in, we're getting ready to open.

235
00:13:52,142 --> 00:13:53,641
I said, no, I quit.

236
00:13:53,642 --> 00:13:56,320
- So, you quit that night?
- I quit that night.

237
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:57,882
I checked Laura's employment records.

238
00:13:57,883 --> 00:14:00,678
And sure enough, she did
quit her job that night.

239
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,565
Okay, so, have you been back here since?

240
00:14:02,566 --> 00:14:05,596
- No.
- Okay. How do you feel now being in here?

241
00:14:05,597 --> 00:14:08,057
Very nervous.

242
00:14:13,338 --> 00:14:18,076
This isn't good. It isn't
cute. It's not funny.

243
00:14:18,077 --> 00:14:21,257
It's kind of demented.

244
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:25,081
That's what they just said.

245
00:14:25,082 --> 00:14:26,588
Who's they?

246
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:28,614
The dead.

247
00:14:28,615 --> 00:14:31,326
As I walk through this mansion,
I keep hearing the dead yelling

248
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:34,841
about how they've had it with
the living antagonizing them.

249
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:38,742
They're repulsed, really repulsed.

250
00:14:44,221 --> 00:14:47,490
Do you know if that's the sort of thing
that living people might pick up on?

251
00:14:47,491 --> 00:14:50,679
I think that they yell at them and...

252
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,632
Try to push them out with their energy.

253
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:57,993
It can be pretty violent.

254
00:15:14,928 --> 00:15:19,199
Todd mentioned his mansion
used to be a Sanitarium.

255
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,291
So I'm heading over to
meet with the County Coroner

256
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:23,476
who knows all the history
about the building.

257
00:15:23,477 --> 00:15:29,377
He says the stuff that went on behind
those walls is gonna turn my stomach.

258
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:38,896
So, Dr. Hadden, the
place I'm investigating,

259
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:40,924
I found out, used to be a Sanitarium.

260
00:15:40,925 --> 00:15:42,117
Yes.

261
00:15:42,118 --> 00:15:44,865
And I was wondering what kind of
patients would have been there.

262
00:15:44,866 --> 00:15:48,495
When it first opened, they
took Tuberculosis patients.

263
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:49,537
Okay.

264
00:15:49,538 --> 00:15:53,293
I have here an ad that we
found in an old phone book.

265
00:15:53,294 --> 00:15:57,164
And it looks like a lovely home.

266
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,616
They make it look inviting.

267
00:15:59,617 --> 00:16:03,772
Yes, but I suspect inside,
it was anything but inviting.

268
00:16:03,773 --> 00:16:05,368
Tuberculosis is very contagious.

269
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:09,478
TB patients are spitting up
blood, coughing uncontrollably.

270
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:14,689
There was loss of weight,
inability to breathe properly.

271
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:18,710
It was a very, very unhappy place.

272
00:16:23,284 --> 00:16:26,224
I see uh, a woman.

273
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:30,845
She's kind of leaning against the wall.

274
00:16:33,365 --> 00:16:37,618
But she's this kind
of weird beigey color.

275
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:39,395
Like she's sick.

276
00:16:39,396 --> 00:16:43,056
Like, I feel, like, nauseated.

277
00:16:45,685 --> 00:16:50,545
Like, I see a guy
throwing up in the corner.

278
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:56,692
Yeah, there's, like, a lot of illne...
I'm feeling a lot of illness here.

279
00:17:01,345 --> 00:17:05,543
Tuberculosis was the second leading
cause of death in The United States,

280
00:17:05,544 --> 00:17:09,957
so you can well imagine that there were
lots and lots of people dying from it.

281
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,059
So, I can assume, a
lot of dead bodies went

282
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,703
through the doors of the
place I'm investigating.

283
00:17:14,704 --> 00:17:15,629
Yes.

284
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,149
We have stories about
how they'd be five or six,

285
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:23,391
bodies at any given time in
the basement of the facility.

286
00:17:23,392 --> 00:17:26,433
They had nothing to do with them
but put them in the basement.

287
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:28,855
Until the mortician
comes to pick them up.

288
00:17:28,856 --> 00:17:31,606
Okay, so, once the person's
dead, are they still contagious?

289
00:17:31,607 --> 00:17:35,064
Yes. It's an incredibly
bad thing to do because,

290
00:17:35,065 --> 00:17:38,751
it can help spread the disease
as the body breaks down.

291
00:17:38,752 --> 00:17:40,672
Okay.

292
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:54,734
There are dead bodies...

293
00:17:54,735 --> 00:17:58,211
Down here. I'm not sure how many.

294
00:17:58,212 --> 00:18:01,632
It rotated, it seems like.

295
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:07,245
They kind of travel as a pack.

296
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,472
And they don't really
want to be bothered.

297
00:18:11,473 --> 00:18:14,667
They want to be left alone.

298
00:18:14,668 --> 00:18:19,528
There's a lot of sadness
and a lot of fear.

299
00:18:21,307 --> 00:18:24,053
You mentioned there were some
horrible things going on in that place.

300
00:18:24,054 --> 00:18:25,919
What are we talking about?

301
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,298
It was very crowded. We know that
they had 1 nurse for 20 patients.

302
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:32,642
- Okay.
- And these are desperately ill people.

303
00:18:32,643 --> 00:18:37,040
These are people who are dying, and one
nurse cannot administer to all their needs.

304
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,434
Okay.

305
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:42,372
Now, the TB epidemic, did it ever
kind of slow down at some point?

306
00:18:42,373 --> 00:18:46,663
Yes, it did, when therapeutics came
in, and that would be in the '50s.

307
00:18:46,664 --> 00:18:50,873
And the medicine worked pretty well, so
sanitariums kind of went out of business.

308
00:18:50,874 --> 00:18:53,088
Okay, so, what happened to
the place I'm investigating?

309
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:54,955
Did they ever get
different patients, or...

310
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:57,897
Well, they looked for a new clientele.

311
00:18:57,898 --> 00:19:00,818
So they took in the mentally ill.

312
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:03,278
You could have severely
depressed patients.

313
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:05,973
You could have schizophrenics.
You could have bipolar.

314
00:19:05,974 --> 00:19:08,342
Okay, so, now they have mental patients,

315
00:19:08,343 --> 00:19:10,926
in this facility where they
used to have TB patients.

316
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:13,328
Did their conditions get
better for the mental patients?

317
00:19:13,329 --> 00:19:15,666
Well, I think they got worse.

318
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:20,061
We do have a list of
transgressions of mistreatment.

319
00:19:20,062 --> 00:19:24,757
And these are people who have filed
complaints against the institution.

320
00:19:24,758 --> 00:19:26,827
They would treat mental
patients very poorly.

321
00:19:26,828 --> 00:19:29,750
They would chain them
to toilets and sinks.

322
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:33,604
They would have them
lying nude in the hallway.

323
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:37,732
Some did electroshock
therapy and lobotomies.

324
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:43,141
Or they'd over medicate them
and make them barely conscious.

325
00:19:43,142 --> 00:19:45,612
Why did this place actually close?

326
00:19:45,613 --> 00:19:50,458
I can only suspect what happened is, as the
state inspection became more stringent...

327
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:53,601
They could not meet the new standards.

328
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:59,502
They had desperately ill people, and they
just did not know what to do with them.

329
00:20:03,575 --> 00:20:07,397
I feel someone being held down...

330
00:20:07,398 --> 00:20:11,977
Against their will. They're
trying to fight back.

331
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:17,878
They're struggling and trying to get
away, and this guy is, like, getting...

332
00:20:18,256 --> 00:20:23,661
Like, his head is, like, slammed
into the wall or something.

333
00:20:23,662 --> 00:20:28,824
There's a lot of crying.
Men and women are crying.

334
00:20:28,825 --> 00:20:31,347
They're screaming.

335
00:20:31,348 --> 00:20:33,550
There's, like, this...

336
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:36,572
Humming noise. A male, like...

337
00:20:36,573 --> 00:20:38,493
Mmmm.

338
00:20:44,883 --> 00:20:50,343
People just died here from
mental or regular illnesses.

339
00:20:51,657 --> 00:20:54,083
Things did happen here.

340
00:20:54,084 --> 00:20:57,924
Accidents that resulted in death.

341
00:21:16,793 --> 00:21:19,589
Todd told me that a bunch of
old records were left behind,

342
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,336
from when this place was a Sanitarium.

343
00:21:22,337 --> 00:21:27,645
As I dig through them, the
same name keeps turning up...

344
00:21:27,646 --> 00:21:30,226
Carl Lamoreaux.

345
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:36,166
I need to find out more about
his connection to this property.

346
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:39,605
I'm on my way to meet with a local
attorney who did some digging for me.

347
00:21:39,606 --> 00:21:45,506
And she said she found some information
that could really help my case.

348
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:53,004
This guy, Lamoreaux, his
name's all over everything.

349
00:21:53,005 --> 00:21:58,083
I mean, patient records,
insurance claims, staff lists.

350
00:21:58,084 --> 00:21:59,856
What were you able
to find out about him?

351
00:21:59,857 --> 00:22:04,369
Well, he ran the facility
from about 1973 until 1985.

352
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:08,210
He died in 1985 at his own facility.

353
00:22:08,211 --> 00:22:11,561
He was only 57 years old at that time.

354
00:22:11,562 --> 00:22:15,209
From what I was told, there was a lot
of abuse in this place at some point.

355
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,407
There were many, many allegations and
complaints brought against the facility.

356
00:22:19,408 --> 00:22:23,473
And many of the claims came out
after his death, interestingly enough.

357
00:22:23,474 --> 00:22:26,175
Why would all these
claims come after he dies?

358
00:22:26,176 --> 00:22:30,179
Well, it appears that Lamoreaux
was somewhat of a public figure.

359
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:34,116
He was a hospital administrator, and
he was somewhat of an intimidating guy.

360
00:22:34,117 --> 00:22:37,749
If he's such a prominent, public figure,
I mean, why would he allow this to happen?

361
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,203
Well, what we discovered
is that he's not just

362
00:22:40,204 --> 00:22:42,072
the administrator for
the Clovis Sanitarium.

363
00:22:42,073 --> 00:22:45,495
He is the administrator for
many other facilities, as well.

364
00:22:45,496 --> 00:22:48,202
And so, he might have been
a little overextended and

365
00:22:48,203 --> 00:22:51,007
might not have really paid a lot of
attention to the Clovis Sanitarium.

366
00:22:51,008 --> 00:22:52,006
Okay.

367
00:22:52,007 --> 00:22:55,844
However, we discovered that a Gladys
Brashears and her husband, Lee,

368
00:22:55,845 --> 00:23:00,187
actually ran the facility from about 1942
all the way until Lamoreaux took over.

369
00:23:00,188 --> 00:23:02,835
Okay, what about them, any
claims that you saw against them?

370
00:23:02,836 --> 00:23:06,542
Well, there's been a lot of complaints and
allegations, as well, against the facility.

371
00:23:06,543 --> 00:23:08,865
However back in those days
there wasn't a lot of oversight,

372
00:23:08,866 --> 00:23:11,327
and a lot of the patients
safety-safeguards that we have,

373
00:23:11,328 --> 00:23:14,868
weren't in place back then.

374
00:23:17,445 --> 00:23:22,612
This man and woman oversaw or were
living here or owned this place.

375
00:23:22,613 --> 00:23:26,645
They're saying that they
took care of things very well.

376
00:23:26,646 --> 00:23:31,441
But I don't trust them.
I think they're liars.

377
00:23:31,442 --> 00:23:36,722
And these two are saying
that they did a good job.

378
00:23:37,724 --> 00:23:40,371
We did a good job. We did
a good job. We did good job.

379
00:23:40,372 --> 00:23:44,841
I'm just, like, no, you know, like,
I don't know what the [Bleep] you did,

380
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:49,162
but you didn't do a good [Bleep] job.

381
00:23:49,282 --> 00:23:53,302
And then I hear partners in crime.

382
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:56,099
It's very bad.

383
00:23:58,514 --> 00:24:01,024
I'm at the library to
see if I can find anything

384
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:05,675
more about Todd's property
prior to it being a Sanitarium.

385
00:24:05,676 --> 00:24:11,576
I don't get any direct hits, but
one article catches my attention.

386
00:24:12,182 --> 00:24:17,317
It turns out a guy named Tony
Andrews originally built the place...

387
00:24:17,318 --> 00:24:20,798
But lost it in foreclosure.

388
00:24:21,823 --> 00:24:24,802
Now that I know the original owner
of the property was foreclosed on,

389
00:24:24,803 --> 00:24:27,731
I need to find out more
about this guy, Tony Andrews.

390
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,181
I've contacted a local genealogist,

391
00:24:30,182 --> 00:24:36,082
who tells me losing the house was only
the beginning of this guy's tragic story.

392
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:43,645
Donette, thanks for meeting
me, I appreciate that.

393
00:24:43,646 --> 00:24:45,811
This guy, Tony Andrews, what
can you tell me about him?

394
00:24:45,812 --> 00:24:49,195
Tony Andrews was from an
Italian immigrant family.

395
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,953
- He's first generation.
- Okay.

396
00:24:50,954 --> 00:24:53,182
He had a lot of dreams.
He had a big ego.

397
00:24:53,183 --> 00:24:54,345
Okay.

398
00:24:54,346 --> 00:24:56,339
He met his beautiful wife, Della.

399
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:02,240
She liked nice things, and he decided to
build her this beautiful, huge mansion.

400
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:04,550
Okay, so, now, how did
he wind up losing it?

401
00:25:04,551 --> 00:25:06,201
He just overspent.

402
00:25:06,202 --> 00:25:08,704
- Okay, so, he lived way above his means.
- He did.

403
00:25:08,705 --> 00:25:12,505
He ended up making an agreement
with one of the neighbors,

404
00:25:12,506 --> 00:25:15,176
that if he could live on
a house on their property,

405
00:25:15,177 --> 00:25:17,596
that he would harvest their grapes.

406
00:25:17,597 --> 00:25:20,512
- What about his wife and kids?
- His wife and kids came with him.

407
00:25:20,513 --> 00:25:23,423
- Oh, so they all lived?
- They all lived in the small house.

408
00:25:23,424 --> 00:25:26,931
They went from their beautiful,
huge mansion to a small home.

409
00:25:26,932 --> 00:25:31,226
And they got room and board for
working the crops on the property.

410
00:25:31,227 --> 00:25:33,464
So, what ended up happening to Tony?

411
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,654
He worked the vineyards
for a couple of years,

412
00:25:35,655 --> 00:25:37,516
and then, unfortunately, he passed away.

413
00:25:37,517 --> 00:25:42,339
He dies at age 36, and I found
his death record right here.

414
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,751
- 36?
- 36 years old.

415
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,800
What did he die of?
Cirrhosis of the liver?

416
00:25:47,801 --> 00:25:49,901
Correct.

417
00:25:52,483 --> 00:25:54,884
So, there's this little guy...

418
00:25:54,885 --> 00:25:59,505
And he says that he
rules the roost here.

419
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:06,015
He...

420
00:26:06,435 --> 00:26:09,129
Is saddened by the state...

421
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,329
Of this location.

422
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:15,050
Because it was quite something.

423
00:26:15,217 --> 00:26:18,771
I feel like he was kind of forced...

424
00:26:18,772 --> 00:26:21,352
To let it go.

425
00:26:21,712 --> 00:26:24,461
It wasn't something he wanted to do.

426
00:26:24,462 --> 00:26:28,072
- Do you know when this was?
- I want to say 1920s.

427
00:26:28,073 --> 00:26:31,973
He never liked people being here.

428
00:26:33,142 --> 00:26:36,174
It's a violation of his privacy.

429
00:26:36,175 --> 00:26:40,579
He's just absolutely
disgusted about everything.

430
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,920
I had this, like, really
bad, bad feeling about him.

431
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:11,744
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations.

432
00:27:11,745 --> 00:27:16,824
We're ready to reveal our findings to our
clients and each other for the first time.

433
00:27:16,825 --> 00:27:18,571
Amy, I'd like you to meet Todd.

434
00:27:18,572 --> 00:27:21,011
He owns this mansion.

435
00:27:21,012 --> 00:27:23,448
This is his sister Glenda.

436
00:27:23,449 --> 00:27:27,624
She's had some bad experiences here, and
as far as she's concerned he should just...

437
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:29,824
Cut his losses and sell the place.

438
00:27:29,825 --> 00:27:32,927
Todd's dream is to
turn this into a hotel.

439
00:27:32,928 --> 00:27:37,991
The activity's gotten so bad
here that he feels it's not safe.

440
00:27:37,992 --> 00:27:40,396
His dream is crumbling around him.

441
00:27:40,397 --> 00:27:42,602
So, with that being said,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy,

442
00:27:42,603 --> 00:27:46,503
we're gonna hear about her walk.

443
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:54,199
So, the first thing that I want
to start off with is that...

444
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,514
There was this guy outside.

445
00:27:56,515 --> 00:28:02,155
And he was telling me how
he once ruled the roost here.

446
00:28:02,508 --> 00:28:05,043
We were looking at the
outside of the structure,

447
00:28:05,044 --> 00:28:07,789
and he was saying how sad he was,

448
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:11,895
that this used to be quite
something when he owned it.

449
00:28:11,896 --> 00:28:17,159
What I got was that he
lost this place in the '20s.

450
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:22,589
He was put in a position where he
had to sell it, he had to give it up.

451
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,702
That makes a lot of sense. The
guy that built this place...

452
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:28,531
Was a first-generation
Italian, Tony Andrews.

453
00:28:28,532 --> 00:28:32,029
And he wound up building
this place in 1922.

454
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,257
You mentioned that he
got in over his head.

455
00:28:35,258 --> 00:28:40,102
Yeah, what happened was, the house
wound up getting foreclosed on in 1927.

456
00:28:40,103 --> 00:28:42,999
And the sad part is that,
when he did sell the house,

457
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,717
he had to go live on a very small bit
of a shack with his wife and two kids.

458
00:28:47,718 --> 00:28:51,056
He died young. He died at 36 years
old of cirrhosis of the liver.

459
00:28:51,057 --> 00:28:53,318
There's his death
certificate right here.

460
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:55,958
The house foreclosed
in '27. He dies in 1929.

461
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:57,544
- Wow.
- Wow.

462
00:28:57,545 --> 00:29:02,165
- Do you think that's who you saw?
- Yes.

463
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:09,906
When I first walked in here, at
the top of the stairs, I see people.

464
00:29:09,907 --> 00:29:13,807
And their energy was not healthy.

465
00:29:16,469 --> 00:29:20,249
They were severely mentally ill.

466
00:29:20,271 --> 00:29:23,782
And they were crawling um...

467
00:29:23,783 --> 00:29:28,823
On the ceiling and down
the side of the stairs.

468
00:29:30,861 --> 00:29:35,872
The ones that were coming down the stairs
were very aggressive, very scary-looking.

469
00:29:35,873 --> 00:29:41,773
And it's almost like this chaos that's
within the mind is now their body.

470
00:29:44,363 --> 00:29:48,888
And some guys vomiting all over the
place, you know, it was pretty uh...

471
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:50,675
Gross.

472
00:29:50,676 --> 00:29:54,717
You looked pretty upset when
she was talking about that.

473
00:29:54,718 --> 00:29:59,110
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to get so emotional, but...

474
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:03,197
I don't know. I just...
it makes me sad to think...

475
00:30:03,198 --> 00:30:06,438
That they're like that.

476
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:12,768
I'm sorry.

477
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:17,399
Well, maybe I can explain to
you what you might have seen.

478
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:22,353
When Andrews lost his house, it went
through various hands over the years.

479
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:26,434
Around 1940, it became a Sanitarium.

480
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:32,462
It housed a lot of elderly people,
and you mentioned about throwing up.

481
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:35,235
- Now, they housed TB patients here.
- Oh.

482
00:30:35,236 --> 00:30:39,528
Matter of fact, I got
an ad from back then.

483
00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:43,789
This is from the beginning right here.

484
00:30:45,748 --> 00:30:48,370
One of the symptoms of
TB is coughing up blood.

485
00:30:48,371 --> 00:30:50,935
- Oh, my gosh.
- Once the TB subsided...

486
00:30:50,936 --> 00:30:56,319
They started bringing in mental
patients, schizophrenics...

487
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,990
All the things you mentioned were
the people that they housed here.

488
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:05,443
I've had people come in here with me,
and out of nowhere, they have thrown up.

489
00:31:05,444 --> 00:31:07,923
Yeah, and I had a friend
that we were in here.

490
00:31:07,924 --> 00:31:12,561
Kind of went through the whole
house, and she got violently ill.

491
00:31:12,562 --> 00:31:16,105
Violently ill. She did throw
up. I took her to the hospital.

492
00:31:16,106 --> 00:31:19,940
She was in the hospital for
three days, and to this day...

493
00:31:19,941 --> 00:31:22,233
They don't know what was wrong with her.

494
00:31:22,234 --> 00:31:27,499
I did a sketch of a scene I
saw when I first walked in here.

495
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,880
There were several dead lined up.

496
00:31:30,881 --> 00:31:32,970
They're very, very thin.

497
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:36,245
And then I saw this man
shifting into this...

498
00:31:36,246 --> 00:31:40,086
Black thing on the second floor.

499
00:31:46,797 --> 00:31:51,117
It's creepy and sad at the same time.

500
00:31:53,023 --> 00:31:54,823
Oh.

501
00:31:57,674 --> 00:32:00,614
I don't like that.

502
00:32:07,851 --> 00:32:11,631
It gets me choked up because...

503
00:32:14,424 --> 00:32:18,984
It feels like there
are people everywhere.

504
00:32:26,665 --> 00:32:28,318
What else did you see on your walk?

505
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:31,919
I saw a lot of mistreatment.

506
00:32:32,415 --> 00:32:37,285
And there was a woman who was
being held down and beaten.

507
00:32:37,286 --> 00:32:41,366
And I saw in the kitchen another...

508
00:32:41,855 --> 00:32:45,695
Patient having his head beat in.

509
00:32:45,853 --> 00:32:47,622
I talked to the County Coroner.

510
00:32:47,623 --> 00:32:50,024
During the time when this
place was run as a Sanitarium,

511
00:32:50,025 --> 00:32:52,394
he said the conditions
here were horrible.

512
00:32:52,395 --> 00:32:56,473
People naked laying on the floor.
They chained people to toilets.

513
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,568
You know, they did electroshock
therapy, even some lobotomy.

514
00:32:59,569 --> 00:33:01,810
- Oh, geez.
- Some of the treatment that happened.

515
00:33:01,811 --> 00:33:05,595
I just can't believe that this
place was actually utilized that way.

516
00:33:05,596 --> 00:33:10,436
It's funny you say that because
it wasn't only just this house.

517
00:33:10,437 --> 00:33:12,896
There used to be a structure
here that housed mental patients,

518
00:33:12,897 --> 00:33:15,284
and Todd had it knocked
down five years ago.

519
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:20,265
We had big trucks come
in and bulldozers and...

520
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,441
Smash everything up and haul it away.

521
00:33:23,442 --> 00:33:26,397
But activity started increasing and,

522
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:29,950
people started experiencing a lot more
things in here, in the mansion itself.

523
00:33:29,951 --> 00:33:31,811
Wow.

524
00:33:33,274 --> 00:33:37,174
The next thing I saw was creepy.

525
00:33:37,507 --> 00:33:40,627
I was upstairs, and...

526
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:45,137
There are these two
people, a man and a woman.

527
00:33:45,138 --> 00:33:47,916
And they were standing in the hallway.

528
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:52,565
They kept repeating
that they did a good job.

529
00:33:52,566 --> 00:33:56,806
They were, like, almost
trying to convince themselves.

530
00:33:56,807 --> 00:34:00,763
I felt that they were liars
because there was all of this death,

531
00:34:00,764 --> 00:34:06,016
and mistreatment around me
and it was just really...

532
00:34:06,017 --> 00:34:08,089
Disgusting.

533
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,546
That's interesting.

534
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:13,771
Let me tell you about a couple
of people that ran this place.

535
00:34:13,772 --> 00:34:17,216
Carl Lamoreaux was in
charge from '73 to '85.

536
00:34:17,217 --> 00:34:19,711
I ran through some records in the attic.

537
00:34:19,712 --> 00:34:23,322
There's stacks here of complaints.

538
00:34:23,323 --> 00:34:26,705
Lamoreaux's name is all over
all the paperwork up there.

539
00:34:26,706 --> 00:34:29,993
Now, prior to that, before
Lamoreaux came into the picture...

540
00:34:29,994 --> 00:34:32,749
- You mentioned a woman.
- Mm-hmm.

541
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:35,922
There was also a woman
named Gladys Brashears.

542
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:40,475
Gladys Brashears ran this place for 40
years during the worst time of its abuse.

543
00:34:40,476 --> 00:34:43,430
She sold this place to Lamoreaux in '73.

544
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:49,331
He passes away here in this
building in '85 at the age of 57.

545
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:55,310
This is his death certificate.

546
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:57,831
- Hmm.
- Wow.

547
00:35:01,545 --> 00:35:03,984
So, what else did you see?

548
00:35:03,985 --> 00:35:06,786
So, then, I went into the basement...

549
00:35:06,787 --> 00:35:10,207
And I saw lots of bodies.

550
00:35:11,141 --> 00:35:13,094
They were being rotated.

551
00:35:13,095 --> 00:35:18,345
Like, bodies were coming and going, coming
and going, and they were trying to leave.

552
00:35:18,346 --> 00:35:24,246
And they were, like, confused and
trying to reach out to get help.

553
00:35:25,396 --> 00:35:28,717
When they reach out, though, would they
reach out to us, like, living people?

554
00:35:28,718 --> 00:35:31,048
They're trying to, yes.

555
00:35:31,049 --> 00:35:33,436
You constantly get
touched when you're here.

556
00:35:33,437 --> 00:35:36,517
Down there, always, mm-hmm.

557
00:35:36,518 --> 00:35:38,202
Now, why her?

558
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:43,089
They'll reach out to whomever
they think can hear, feel, see.

559
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:47,639
So, you're probably a
sensitive in some respects.

560
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,506
I think I can explain the
bodies in the basement.

561
00:35:50,507 --> 00:35:55,687
During the TB epidemic, it was
so bad, the bodies were piling up.

562
00:35:55,688 --> 00:35:58,472
They were dying, they'd
pile 'em in the basement.

563
00:35:58,473 --> 00:36:03,380
It could be five, six days before the
mortician would come for these bodies.

564
00:36:03,381 --> 00:36:09,281
The other thing I got was, I'm
feeling fear from the living here.

565
00:36:09,578 --> 00:36:12,304
Over many, many years...

566
00:36:12,305 --> 00:36:16,625
The living have left their fear behind.

567
00:36:18,212 --> 00:36:19,779
And it's not healthy.

568
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:23,320
I mean, it's tangible fear.

569
00:36:24,797 --> 00:36:28,702
I got that there are
sensitives walking the place.

570
00:36:28,703 --> 00:36:31,283
I got seances.

571
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,637
People trying to communicate
with the dead here.

572
00:36:35,638 --> 00:36:39,838
Unfortunately, when that happens, it...

573
00:36:40,138 --> 00:36:42,598
Leaves scars.

574
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,063
I'm gonna call you on
the carpet now, all right?

575
00:36:47,064 --> 00:36:50,519
Why don't you tell Amy what you've
done to make money in this place,

576
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:55,338
to turn this into a
dream hotel for yourself?

577
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:58,667
Well, when I first bought the
property, my goal was to...

578
00:36:58,668 --> 00:37:02,970
Eventually make it into a hotel, a
beautiful place, but in the meantime...

579
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:06,931
I had a Halloween attraction here.

580
00:37:08,305 --> 00:37:11,392
So, over the 21/2 weeks that
we were open for 8 years...

581
00:37:11,393 --> 00:37:16,433
- Over 30,000 people came through.
- Holy [Bleep]

582
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:19,362
Why don't you explain to her how
many paranormal investigations...

583
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:22,497
A lot of paranormal investigators
have come in over the years.

584
00:37:22,498 --> 00:37:24,494
You told me at least 100
teams came through here.

585
00:37:24,495 --> 00:37:27,361
Oh, yeah, absolutely, mm-hmm.

586
00:37:27,362 --> 00:37:32,737
And my ultimate goal would be to completely
refurbish it back to a beautiful home.

587
00:37:32,738 --> 00:37:35,473
- And pass it down to my son.
- Mm-hmm.

588
00:37:35,474 --> 00:37:40,470
And have it opened up for the
public to come in and stay the night.

589
00:37:40,471 --> 00:37:43,231
As a nice hotel?

590
00:37:43,374 --> 00:37:46,509
- As a nice hotel.
- Not a haunted hotel?

591
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:50,954
Well, if people have an experience
in here, I can't control that.

592
00:37:50,955 --> 00:37:54,951
But if people do want to
come in here, it's up to them.

593
00:37:54,952 --> 00:37:59,872
But would you advertise
it as a haunted hotel?

594
00:38:18,808 --> 00:38:22,976
If people have an experience
in here, I can't control that.

595
00:38:22,977 --> 00:38:26,919
But if people do want to
come in here, it's up to them.

596
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:31,840
But would you advertise
it as a haunted hotel?

597
00:38:37,309 --> 00:38:39,169
Yes.

598
00:38:41,568 --> 00:38:45,120
How would you like to die
and be tormented and stuck?

599
00:38:45,121 --> 00:38:48,463
Think of the most [Bleep]
that happened in your life.

600
00:38:48,464 --> 00:38:53,208
The worst [Bleep] you've ever been through,
and you're reliving that every single day.

601
00:38:53,209 --> 00:38:57,112
And now you're gonna be
[Bleep] with through eternity.

602
00:38:57,113 --> 00:38:58,724
Really think about that.

603
00:38:58,725 --> 00:39:02,361
I'm just saying, it bothers me.

604
00:39:02,362 --> 00:39:06,658
You know, like I said, when I walk in, I
say hello, I have respect for what's here.

605
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:08,970
And so you should.

606
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:12,007
Because you have a lot
of dead people here.

607
00:39:12,008 --> 00:39:15,548
And most of them want help.

608
00:39:15,632 --> 00:39:18,982
They are kind of at their wits' end.

609
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:23,160
They're going to really
start to become aggressive.

610
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:27,001
I ain't coming back here, Todd.

611
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,010
Well, Todd, you've seen the
results of the investigation,

612
00:39:33,011 --> 00:39:35,396
and what we came up with.

613
00:39:35,397 --> 00:39:39,344
You still caused a lot of the problems
here, but the big question is...

614
00:39:39,345 --> 00:39:44,520
Can you turn this place into
the dream hotel that you want to?

615
00:39:44,521 --> 00:39:50,421
I can't answer that, but hopefully
Amy can give you some answers.

616
00:39:51,444 --> 00:39:54,564
You need to provide...

617
00:39:55,195 --> 00:39:59,455
Counseling for the dead that are here.

618
00:39:59,622 --> 00:40:05,297
It would be great if you can
find a transpersonal psychologist.

619
00:40:05,298 --> 00:40:09,096
Transpersonal psychologists are
trained to deal with the mentally ill.

620
00:40:09,097 --> 00:40:10,743
And a lot of them are sensitives,

621
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:14,506
so they should be able to
help with the people here.

622
00:40:14,507 --> 00:40:17,962
Unfortunately, for the ones who
don't respond to treatment...

623
00:40:17,963 --> 00:40:22,001
These are probably going to be the more
aggressive individuals that are here.

624
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:27,240
And they'll have to be probably
more aggressively moved out.

625
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:30,894
How do you aggressively get
rid of the rest of the dead?

626
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:34,915
Exorcism would be the way I'd go.

627
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,647
They're not human anymore.

628
00:40:37,648 --> 00:40:43,034
The exorcism would knock those
suckers right out of here.

629
00:40:43,035 --> 00:40:46,635
I mean, these are sociopaths.

630
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:49,510
These are killers.

631
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,055
Well, it sounds like you have
all intentions of not listening,

632
00:40:52,056 --> 00:40:55,776
and making it a haunted hotel.

633
00:40:57,393 --> 00:40:59,493
Correct.

634
00:41:01,571 --> 00:41:06,190
Since you're gonna list this as a
haunted bed-and-breakfast or whatever.

635
00:41:06,191 --> 00:41:11,540
If you do that, the people that
stay here do it at their own risk.

636
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:15,405
Also let them know that the
dead that are still here,

637
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:18,946
at that time are aggressive.

638
00:41:19,235 --> 00:41:21,386
You're putting yourself at risk.

639
00:41:21,387 --> 00:41:24,929
I'm just gonna tell ya, you are.

640
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:29,791
And the guests who stay
here will be at risk.

641
00:41:29,792 --> 00:41:35,692
Now, would you at least follow Amy's
advice before you open the hotel?

642
00:41:36,979 --> 00:41:39,259
Absolutely.

643
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,459
I appreciate that Todd was honest
about opening a haunted hotel.

644
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,224
But that doesn't mean we're gonna
lead people to the front door.

645
00:41:47,225 --> 00:41:51,626
If you really want to help him torment the
dead, I'm sure you can find his location.

646
00:41:51,627 --> 00:41:56,576
But you're gonna have to
deal with the consequences.
