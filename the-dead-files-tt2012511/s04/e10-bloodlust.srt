Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:12,009
People here...

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,972
Feel watched.

4
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:15,616
Something's here.

5
00:00:15,617 --> 00:00:17,208
He's sick.

6
00:00:17,209 --> 00:00:18,419
I was pretty scared.

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,422
They gang up on people, smother them.

8
00:00:21,423 --> 00:00:22,990
I thought he was having a heart attack.

9
00:00:22,991 --> 00:00:24,869
That was a suicide.

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,661
She walked into her
bedroom and killed herself.

11
00:00:27,662 --> 00:00:30,731
He is darkness. He is evil.

12
00:00:30,732 --> 00:00:32,229
Is he dangerous?

13
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,635
He's a [Bleep] lunatic.

14
00:00:34,636 --> 00:00:37,756
He really hates women.

15
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:42,864
They're being watched.

16
00:00:42,865 --> 00:00:45,950
My name is Amy Allan.

17
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:48,215
This thing likes death.

18
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:49,730
I see dead people.

19
00:00:49,731 --> 00:00:51,358
This thing's, like, a monster.

20
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:53,440
I speak to dead people.

21
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:55,156
And he's pissed off now.

22
00:00:55,157 --> 00:00:56,674
And they speak to me.

23
00:00:56,675 --> 00:00:58,091
His head was cracked.

24
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:01,743
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

25
00:01:01,744 --> 00:01:03,030
This guy was murdered.

26
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:04,861
I rely on my partner.

27
00:01:04,862 --> 00:01:08,038
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

28
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:10,871
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

29
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:13,942
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

30
00:01:13,943 --> 00:01:15,322
You saw her?

31
00:01:15,323 --> 00:01:16,759
It's my job to reveal them.

32
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,911
Why would you stay here?

33
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:20,044
But Steve and I never speak...

34
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:22,190
We never communicate
during an investigation.

35
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:23,582
Until the very end.

36
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,347
Stop it.

37
00:01:25,348 --> 00:01:27,188
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

38
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:29,864
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

39
00:01:29,865 --> 00:01:31,096
Or time to get out.

40
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:35,837
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

41
00:01:55,517 --> 00:01:59,119
Amy and I conduct our
investigations separately.

42
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,549
While she talks to the dead...

43
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,987
I interview living witnesses who've
experienced things they can't explain.

44
00:02:05,988 --> 00:02:11,315
I dig into the property's history,
looking for secrets buried in the past.

45
00:02:11,316 --> 00:02:14,496
I'm in Buffalo, Wyoming, a
couple hours north of Casper.

46
00:02:14,497 --> 00:02:16,703
I'm heading over to meet
with a woman named Dawn.

47
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,577
She's spent the last 15
years and her life savings

48
00:02:19,578 --> 00:02:23,377
trying to restore an old hotel in town.

49
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:26,447
Problem is, her employees
are scared to come to work

50
00:02:26,448 --> 00:02:28,915
and her guests are being attacked.

51
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:34,816
She tells me that, if we can't help her,
she may have to close the place down.

52
00:02:41,062 --> 00:02:42,515
Before Amy arrives,

53
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:46,967
I have to clear the area of anything
that could influence her findings.

54
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:50,006
This hotel is filled with
Wild West relics and portraits

55
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:54,087
that have to be covered or removed.

56
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:00,840
When I'm finished, the property
will be ready for tonight's walk.

57
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,520
Oh, boy.

58
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:19,933
There's quite a few people.

59
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:24,194
There's a woman. She's pretty petite.

60
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:28,275
She's saying that there has been...

61
00:03:28,276 --> 00:03:30,556
Foul play.

62
00:03:30,657 --> 00:03:33,889
She keeps saying drugs were involved.

63
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:38,090
And she's very distressed about this.

64
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:43,551
She was a manipulated innocent victim.

65
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:46,841
And she really got the
short end of the stick.

66
00:03:46,842 --> 00:03:51,822
- What do you mean?
- Well, she ended up dying.

67
00:04:06,448 --> 00:04:08,288
Dawn, good to meet you finally.

68
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,911
Good to meet you.

69
00:04:09,912 --> 00:04:13,086
This place is amazing. It's like
stepping back into the Wild West.

70
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:15,155
It was the Wild West.

71
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:19,289
She was built in 1880, right here on
the frontier before there was a town.

72
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,076
So, this is the original structure?

73
00:04:21,077 --> 00:04:23,911
It was torn down right in 1900,

74
00:04:23,912 --> 00:04:26,714
and the big, brick structure
you see today was built.

75
00:04:26,715 --> 00:04:29,184
Okay. Now, has this always been a hotel?

76
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:32,317
Always a hotel, but she
was a full-service hotel.

77
00:04:32,318 --> 00:04:36,264
We had a saloon, we had a brothel,
even the original Courthouse,

78
00:04:36,265 --> 00:04:39,037
took place here before
the Courthouse was built.

79
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:41,028
Okay. Dawn, when'd you buy this place?

80
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:45,266
Bought the building in 1997, and she
was within months of being demolished.

81
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:47,101
And you run this place by yourself?

82
00:04:47,102 --> 00:04:49,804
I do have two partners,
David and Jackie.

83
00:04:49,805 --> 00:04:52,124
Okay. So, I know you got
some problems going on.

84
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,803
Why don't you tell me what's happening?

85
00:04:53,804 --> 00:04:59,581
We've had footsteps and giggles,
apparitions, and people being touched.

86
00:04:59,582 --> 00:05:02,684
Okay. Now, what's your biggest concern?

87
00:05:02,685 --> 00:05:07,545
Safety of our employees,
safety of our guests.

88
00:05:07,989 --> 00:05:11,626
I could tell Dawn was used to being
strong for everyone at the hotel,

89
00:05:11,627 --> 00:05:14,625
but I could also see
she was about to crack.

90
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:19,300
Okay, so, now, you have employees
and guests having bad experiences.

91
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:22,241
What about yourself?

92
00:05:22,862 --> 00:05:25,442
You all right?

93
00:05:26,863 --> 00:05:31,346
I had a wonderful life until
we moved into this building.

94
00:05:31,347 --> 00:05:34,910
It's been 16 years of hell.

95
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:37,619
I love this place, but I want out.

96
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,354
You want out, but you can't let go.

97
00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:41,520
I can't.

98
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:44,250
Something's here.

99
00:05:44,251 --> 00:05:46,171
Okay.

100
00:05:55,170 --> 00:06:00,475
This place has been used for
a lot of different things.

101
00:06:00,476 --> 00:06:04,675
There's a lot of residual information...

102
00:06:04,676 --> 00:06:08,336
But it's very in-your-face.

103
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,252
It's almost like you
could interact with it.

104
00:06:11,253 --> 00:06:13,381
Like, people here...

105
00:06:13,382 --> 00:06:15,951
They feel um...

106
00:06:15,952 --> 00:06:18,052
Watched.

107
00:06:19,976 --> 00:06:23,936
The living here, they're panicked.

108
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:40,095
This is the oldest wing, and the
most active part of the hotel.

109
00:06:40,306 --> 00:06:43,518
During restoration, we elected
not to put a bedroom in this room

110
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,354
because we felt that our guests
simply could not sleep here.

111
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:48,823
Okay, so what's some of the
things that are happening?

112
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:51,693
There's times when things
just move on their own...

113
00:06:51,694 --> 00:06:54,762
Benches, rocking chairs, mirrors.

114
00:06:54,763 --> 00:06:56,497
So, that's hurting your business.

115
00:06:56,498 --> 00:07:01,201
Yeah, we had one customer that picked up
the house phone at 3:30 in the morning,

116
00:07:01,202 --> 00:07:05,121
screaming that things were
flying around his room.

117
00:07:05,122 --> 00:07:08,422
And he was out of here.

118
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,050
I just see this woman.

119
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:19,085
She's 60s...

120
00:07:19,086 --> 00:07:22,146
Short... like 5 foot.

121
00:07:23,892 --> 00:07:27,094
She does a lot of activity in this room.

122
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:28,996
Do you know if anybody sees her?

123
00:07:28,997 --> 00:07:34,577
I think people would hear
her, because she's very loud.

124
00:07:36,037 --> 00:07:39,510
I don't think she likes
this room very much.

125
00:07:39,511 --> 00:07:42,142
Because it's been restructured...

126
00:07:42,143 --> 00:07:44,604
And she hates it.

127
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:46,979
So, what does she do in
here when she's upset?

128
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,800
She moves [Bleep].

129
00:07:50,853 --> 00:07:53,613
This is no good.

130
00:08:00,463 --> 00:08:02,387
So, Dave, I was speaking with Dawn,

131
00:08:02,388 --> 00:08:05,672
and she's told me about the
experiences that employees...

132
00:08:05,673 --> 00:08:08,135
Guests, and her have
had. How about yourself?

133
00:08:08,136 --> 00:08:09,970
On the front staircase in the lobby,

134
00:08:09,971 --> 00:08:12,139
there was a gentleman coming
up behind his family...

135
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,574
Big, cumbersome cowboy.

136
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:19,289
And all of a sudden, he just clutched
the handrail there and just turned white.

137
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,476
I thought he was having a heart
attack. And I said, "Sir, are you okay?"

138
00:08:23,477 --> 00:08:27,884
And he looked at me, he said, "it was
like a light went right through me."

139
00:08:27,885 --> 00:08:30,587
I said, "would you like
to go down and sit down?"

140
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:32,854
And he said, "no. I need to leave."

141
00:08:32,855 --> 00:08:34,816
Okay have you ever
experienced anything like that?

142
00:08:34,817 --> 00:08:38,256
Never. But I came down
here on a Sunday afternoon

143
00:08:38,257 --> 00:08:40,367
to change out a smoke-detector battery.

144
00:08:40,368 --> 00:08:43,402
- Okay.
- And this giggling began.

145
00:08:43,403 --> 00:08:45,853
It sounded just like
a small child giggling.

146
00:08:45,854 --> 00:08:47,363
That spooked me a little bit.

147
00:08:47,364 --> 00:08:49,417
And I've talked to
many guests that tell me

148
00:08:49,418 --> 00:08:52,212
they've seen a small
girl about 7 years old.

149
00:08:52,213 --> 00:08:54,489
And they always tell
me that she's a blonde.

150
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,251
Now, did you believe in
any of this stuff before?

151
00:08:57,252 --> 00:08:59,009
No, I've been very skeptical.

152
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:04,470
But I absolutely know that
there's something going on.

153
00:09:06,983 --> 00:09:11,055
I'm seeing two young kids,
and then there's an older girl.

154
00:09:11,056 --> 00:09:13,486
The two younger ones are...

155
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:16,427
Six or seven maybe.

156
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:20,446
And they're blonde.

157
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:25,079
What sort of things can they do?

158
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,429
They try to talk to people.

159
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:32,533
I would think that
people would feel them...

160
00:09:32,534 --> 00:09:35,322
Because they're very present...

161
00:09:35,323 --> 00:09:36,858
Uh, solid.

162
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:39,739
They're very here.

163
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,431
Dave told me to get in touch with the

164
00:09:49,432 --> 00:09:52,339
guy who works on the
hotel's fire-alarm system.

165
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:58,240
Apparently, he encountered something
terrifying while on the job.

166
00:10:03,251 --> 00:10:06,026
Now, what kind of experiences
are you having down here?

167
00:10:06,027 --> 00:10:09,856
I was working in the basement
with my flashlight and bumped into,

168
00:10:09,857 --> 00:10:12,026
what I thought was a person.

169
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:14,274
Began speaking to this person.
Saying, "hey, you know",

170
00:10:14,275 --> 00:10:16,277
what are you doing standing
down here in the dark?"

171
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:18,365
- Okay.
- No answer. No nothing.

172
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:21,836
I continued on my way up the
stairs. You could hear my footsteps.

173
00:10:21,837 --> 00:10:23,370
You could hear footsteps behind me.

174
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:26,273
I got to the top of the stairs, turned
around and shined the flashlight,

175
00:10:26,274 --> 00:10:29,711
and there was nothing there.

176
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,612
Could it have been a
patron that was down here?

177
00:10:31,613 --> 00:10:35,282
Why they would be down in the basement
would make absolutely no sense.

178
00:10:35,283 --> 00:10:37,952
And there was no
maintenance worker on duty,

179
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:40,454
there was nobody that should
have been down in the basement.

180
00:10:40,455 --> 00:10:42,888
Okay, prior to running into
this thing, you didn't hear

181
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:45,091
any scuffling around on the
floor or anything like that?

182
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:46,294
Nope.

183
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:49,322
Do other people from your
company come here, as well?

184
00:10:49,323 --> 00:10:53,452
Yes, and everyone that I
have brought down here to work

185
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,501
has a little bit of a
reluctance to come back.

186
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:58,422
Okay.

187
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,190
There's people down here.

188
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:22,683
They're trying to look for a way
out, and it's really irritating them.

189
00:11:22,684 --> 00:11:27,904
There's maybe 5 to 15 of
them at any given time.

190
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:34,396
And they don't like it when people come
down here and are not trying to help them,

191
00:11:34,397 --> 00:11:36,276
and they kind of rebel.

192
00:11:36,277 --> 00:11:39,933
What do you mean? What do they do?

193
00:11:39,934 --> 00:11:42,322
They gang up on people.

194
00:11:42,323 --> 00:11:47,423
Like, they surround them,
like, they smother them.

195
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:52,681
I feel, um...

196
00:11:53,228 --> 00:11:55,148
Pain.

197
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:02,641
It is, like, really painful.

198
00:12:27,188 --> 00:12:29,469
I understand that you
worked here at one time.

199
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,721
- I did.
- Okay. For how long?

200
00:12:30,722 --> 00:12:32,439
I worked here for six months.

201
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,108
- Okay. What did you do?
- I was the bartender in the saloon.

202
00:12:35,109 --> 00:12:38,178
Okay, so, now, I understand
you've had experiences here.

203
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:41,615
There's something in the basement that's
definitely a little unnerving for me.

204
00:12:41,616 --> 00:12:44,417
- I won't go down there.
- Why do you say that?

205
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:48,355
My stomach starts to hurt and I get
goose bumps, start to sweat a little bit.

206
00:12:48,356 --> 00:12:51,224
Okay. Is that the only stuff
that happened to you here?

207
00:12:51,225 --> 00:12:55,362
No, I've seen some apparitions, as well.

208
00:12:55,363 --> 00:12:59,533
I walked through the
saloon door over here...

209
00:12:59,534 --> 00:13:03,436
And I got halfway through the room
before I realized that I felt like

210
00:13:03,437 --> 00:13:06,339
somebody was standing
behind me, watching me.

211
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,942
And when I turned, there was a
gentleman standing in the corner.

212
00:13:09,943 --> 00:13:12,774
Now, was it something you could
see through or was he solid?

213
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:15,649
No, he was solid, and that
was really scary for me,

214
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:21,550
just the fact that I could
feel him before I could see him.

215
00:13:24,748 --> 00:13:26,893
There's a man in here.

216
00:13:26,894 --> 00:13:29,343
He's not nice.

217
00:13:29,344 --> 00:13:33,244
And he does hide in the shadows.

218
00:13:34,968 --> 00:13:37,308
He likes...

219
00:13:37,591 --> 00:13:40,343
To bother people.

220
00:13:40,344 --> 00:13:41,940
He...

221
00:13:41,941 --> 00:13:45,121
Is the main bad ass...

222
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:47,565
Here.

223
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:54,863
He's very mean to women.

224
00:13:54,864 --> 00:13:58,104
He likes to hurt women.

225
00:14:09,237 --> 00:14:11,504
- How long did you work here?
- For about eight months.

226
00:14:11,505 --> 00:14:12,991
- Eight months.
- Yeah.

227
00:14:12,992 --> 00:14:15,154
Now, I've talked to a few
people that have worked here,

228
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:16,716
I assume you've had some experiences.

229
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:19,363
- I've had a few.
- Okay. Tell me about them.

230
00:14:19,364 --> 00:14:23,444
I was doing prep in the cafe area.

231
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:28,393
And I was just standing, you know, just
minding my own, listening to the radio.

232
00:14:28,394 --> 00:14:32,574
I started to feel a tickle on my neck.

233
00:14:32,575 --> 00:14:37,576
Then I had my ponytail tugged, kind
of jerked my head back a little bit.

234
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,956
I was pretty scared.

235
00:14:39,957 --> 00:14:43,956
I didn't know what to think or what
to do, so I just... I stood still.

236
00:14:43,957 --> 00:14:49,477
And a deep man's voice
whispered my name into my ear.

237
00:14:52,553 --> 00:14:55,214
It was like... "Alissa".

238
00:14:55,215 --> 00:14:58,385
Like it was a deep-enough
sound that I would hear it.

239
00:14:58,386 --> 00:15:00,153
I didn't know what to think, you know?

240
00:15:00,154 --> 00:15:03,356
And you don't really think
something like that's gonna happen.

241
00:15:03,357 --> 00:15:06,426
You hear other people talk about it and
you think, you know, it's just a lie.

242
00:15:06,427 --> 00:15:08,295
It's not real. It's not real.

243
00:15:08,296 --> 00:15:09,629
And then once you experience it,

244
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:14,970
you know, you have to
realize, "well, that is real."

245
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,393
He likes the neck.

246
00:15:19,394 --> 00:15:23,094
He likes to squeeze the
back of the neck, like...

247
00:15:23,095 --> 00:15:26,395
Come up and squeeze 'em.

248
00:15:27,132 --> 00:15:33,032
You know, touching people, grabbing
people, you know, specifically women.

249
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:38,047
Like, grabbing them,
touching them inappropriate.

250
00:15:38,048 --> 00:15:42,014
There's just a big, solid, black mass.

251
00:15:42,015 --> 00:15:46,933
And the reason why he's all, like,
black like that and misty like that is,

252
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:50,750
like, he relates darkness to evil.

253
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:54,841
And he is darkness, he
is what he thinks is evil.

254
00:15:54,842 --> 00:15:58,202
And so, that's his soul.

255
00:15:58,612 --> 00:16:01,848
I was gonna ask you, how
do you feel being back here?

256
00:16:01,849 --> 00:16:04,894
Soon as I came into the
hotel, I just felt...

257
00:16:04,895 --> 00:16:08,888
I just felt weird. Like, I just
felt really emotionally unstable.

258
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:12,425
Okay, now, have you ever had an
experience since you left here?

259
00:16:12,426 --> 00:16:13,860
No.

260
00:16:13,861 --> 00:16:17,831
I've never had an experience
before until I started working here.

261
00:16:17,832 --> 00:16:22,156
Now, do you think
whatever's here is dangerous?

262
00:16:22,157 --> 00:16:24,077
Yeah.

263
00:16:26,173 --> 00:16:30,373
He really, really, really hates women.

264
00:16:31,545 --> 00:16:34,056
I don't [Bleep] care.

265
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:36,148
Yell at me all you want.

266
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:37,517
What is he yelling?

267
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:43,418
Well, he just got mad and started
to, you know, call me a [Bleep].

268
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:48,995
Any men who have compassion for women,
any men who treat women well, whatever,

269
00:16:48,996 --> 00:16:50,656
he perceives as weak.

270
00:16:50,657 --> 00:16:53,312
He's gonna [Bleep] with
them, Matt, you know, too.

271
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:56,703
What does he do to the weak men?

272
00:16:56,704 --> 00:17:01,078
He just makes them feel very uncomfortable,
like somebody's in the room with them...

273
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,976
And is, like, right up on them.

274
00:17:03,977 --> 00:17:06,579
A very strong presence.

275
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,114
He's a [Bleep] lunatic.

276
00:17:08,115 --> 00:17:12,552
Okay. Would you say that he's dangerous?

277
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,413
Yes.

278
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:32,010
I'm at the local
library to find out more

279
00:17:32,011 --> 00:17:36,571
about the history of
the Occidental Hotel.

280
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:43,823
Digging through the archives, I
discover something completely unexpected.

281
00:17:43,824 --> 00:17:46,515
A former owner of the
hotel was murdered.

282
00:17:46,516 --> 00:17:52,416
But the headlines don't say
who did it or how it went down.

283
00:17:52,468 --> 00:17:56,257
Now that I know one of the hotel owners
was murdered in a high-profile case,

284
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:58,507
I need to get the full picture.

285
00:17:58,508 --> 00:18:00,862
I'm headed over to meet with
the Johnson County Sheriff.

286
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:06,623
He tells me that the case
has a lot of twists and turns.

287
00:18:12,941 --> 00:18:15,744
What do you know about
this guy that was murdered?

288
00:18:15,745 --> 00:18:20,382
Well, Fred Waegele was a very prominent
citizen in Johnson County at this time.

289
00:18:20,383 --> 00:18:22,449
He owned a ranch south of Buffalo.

290
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:27,490
He owned the Occidental
Hotel from 1906 to 1917.

291
00:18:28,054 --> 00:18:32,418
So, you know, he was a very prominent,
well-known person in the community.

292
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:35,463
Steve, how does Fred
become a homicide victim?

293
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:38,332
Fred had a son named
Max who was 20 years old,

294
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:41,384
and Max ended up marrying
a young lady named Marion...

295
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:43,270
- Okay.
- Who was 17.

296
00:18:43,271 --> 00:18:45,214
And subsequently Fred,

297
00:18:45,215 --> 00:18:49,404
ended up sexually assaulting and
raping Marion several different times.

298
00:18:49,405 --> 00:18:52,785
Oh, geez. All right, so,
she's 17. How old was he?

299
00:18:52,786 --> 00:18:54,616
He was 60.

300
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:57,792
And actually, at one
point, she becomes pregnant.

301
00:18:57,793 --> 00:19:01,913
And she's afraid that the child is his.

302
00:19:01,914 --> 00:19:07,734
She ends up having a miscarriage,
you know, loses the baby.

303
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:14,012
This guy... he does bad things.

304
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,773
Everything he did in life to
women, he tries to do to them,

305
00:19:17,774 --> 00:19:20,074
you know, now that he's dead.

306
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,709
This is Western [Bleep].

307
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:27,410
Like, he's a drinker, he's
a gunfighter, he's a rapist.

308
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:36,141
I don't like him. He's sick.

309
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:40,261
So, who ends up killing him?

310
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,364
Marion ends up murdering Fred
Waegele, her father-in-law.

311
00:19:43,365 --> 00:19:45,800
Okay, and how does she do that?

312
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:48,277
Well, she'd come up with a very
ingenious plan of doing that.

313
00:19:48,278 --> 00:19:51,639
Fred was taking
medication for rheumatism,

314
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,297
and he's getting his
medication in the mail.

315
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:59,393
So, she ended up putting a cyanide
tablet in the mail and mailing it to him.

316
00:19:59,394 --> 00:20:02,416
And he takes it, thinking
that's his rheumatism medicine.

317
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:05,000
Okay. Now, I know a
little bit about cyanide.

318
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:07,294
Does he die instantly or does he linger?

319
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,892
No, he lingers for a
little period of time.

320
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:14,472
Cyanide death is a very painful
death. You know, you can't breathe.

321
00:20:14,473 --> 00:20:17,234
- Right.
- It causes excruciating chest pains.

322
00:20:17,235 --> 00:20:19,767
And eventually ends
up to cardiac arrest.

323
00:20:19,768 --> 00:20:23,848
It's a very unpleasant way to die.

324
00:20:29,287 --> 00:20:31,312
Something's wrong with his chest.

325
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,953
Like, he has...

326
00:20:34,082 --> 00:20:37,022
A breathing problem.

327
00:20:39,928 --> 00:20:42,928
He feels very alone.

328
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,970
He does not feel good about his life.

329
00:20:46,971 --> 00:20:49,551
He's so sick.

330
00:20:49,632 --> 00:20:53,532
Ugh, he's a mess. He's a mess.

331
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:59,340
What winds up happening with
her? Does she get caught?

332
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,475
She eventually does get caught.

333
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:05,343
A gentleman by the name of
Wolcott and Joe LaFors...

334
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:07,982
Somehow get involved
in this investigation

335
00:21:07,983 --> 00:21:10,652
and end up getting a
confession from this young lady.

336
00:21:10,653 --> 00:21:14,133
And this is her confession.

337
00:21:15,168 --> 00:21:17,759
And she confesses that the
reason she does all this...

338
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,126
Is because of the...

339
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:20,933
- Of the rape.
- Yeah.

340
00:21:20,934 --> 00:21:23,197
So, Steve, does she
wind up going to jail?

341
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,399
No, she never was arrested for this.

342
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,136
She typed this confession in her home...

343
00:21:29,137 --> 00:21:31,639
- Okay.
- With her father and family, I believe.

344
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:37,540
And then she walked into her bedroom and
took cyanide herself and killed herself.

345
00:21:41,784 --> 00:21:45,887
I'm seeing this grumpy old woman again.

346
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:51,358
And she says there were some
dirty dealings that went on.

347
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,696
There have been things
that have happened.

348
00:21:54,697 --> 00:21:58,957
People doing things that weren't good.

349
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:03,765
There was one death and...

350
00:22:03,766 --> 00:22:06,020
It was a tragedy.

351
00:22:06,021 --> 00:22:08,376
And this was not good.

352
00:22:08,377 --> 00:22:10,478
It's awful. It's terrible.

353
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:13,899
Like, definitely a suicide.

354
00:22:32,212 --> 00:22:35,114
Dawn mentioned the hotel used
to be a makeshift Courthouse.

355
00:22:35,115 --> 00:22:38,813
If that's true, it could
be useful to my case.

356
00:22:38,814 --> 00:22:41,020
I'm heading over to meet
the County prosecutor

357
00:22:41,021 --> 00:22:46,921
who says a hanging Judge used to
operate right out of the hotel.

358
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:56,546
My client said that the
Occidental Hotel I'm investigating,

359
00:22:56,547 --> 00:22:58,317
used to be a Courthouse.

360
00:22:58,318 --> 00:23:02,509
Yes, around the years 1884 through 1886,

361
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,810
the Occidental was sometimes
used as a Courthouse,

362
00:23:04,811 --> 00:23:07,470
because the current Courthouse
was under construction.

363
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:10,593
Did any noteworthy cases go
through the hotel at that time?

364
00:23:10,594 --> 00:23:13,190
Yes, one that's still
talked about today.

365
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:17,003
Around 1884, there was a murder of a...

366
00:23:17,004 --> 00:23:19,392
Jacob Schmerer.

367
00:23:19,393 --> 00:23:21,837
- He was a cook at the Occidental.
- Okay.

368
00:23:21,838 --> 00:23:26,938
Now, this is a sketch of
his killer, Bill Booth.

369
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:32,731
Booth was going to provide
venison to Jacob Schmerer.

370
00:23:32,732 --> 00:23:35,908
Booth didn't, and a fight
ensued between the two,

371
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:40,049
and Booth bludgeoned him with an ax.

372
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:44,106
He gets caught, and in
1885, he goes to trial.

373
00:23:44,107 --> 00:23:47,794
At that trial, he's convicted
of first-degree murder.

374
00:23:47,795 --> 00:23:52,758
Then he also confessed to murdering
his wife, two small children,

375
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:55,024
and at least about 12
other people he knew.

376
00:23:55,025 --> 00:23:57,597
Oh, geez. Is he eventually hanged?

377
00:23:57,598 --> 00:24:01,033
Yes. They hang him in the
back of the Occidental Hotel.

378
00:24:01,034 --> 00:24:03,336
This is a newspaper
article from the time.

379
00:24:03,337 --> 00:24:05,904
So, this appears to be the
biggest story of its time.

380
00:24:05,905 --> 00:24:08,005
It was.

381
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:14,147
I'm getting that there's
another suicide here.

382
00:24:14,148 --> 00:24:18,948
Seems like some boy,
young man, hung himself.

383
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:22,539
Where'd he [Bleep] die?

384
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:27,160
Well, I kind of felt
it was further down.

385
00:24:31,331 --> 00:24:34,400
I'm looking for where I feel
another man hanged himself...

386
00:24:34,401 --> 00:24:38,688
But this grumpy old lady keeps telling
me there's only one suicide here.

387
00:24:38,689 --> 00:24:42,955
And she says there's
something important there...

388
00:24:42,956 --> 00:24:46,496
That I'm not quite getting.

389
00:24:48,448 --> 00:24:52,168
It's really bothering me, too.

390
00:24:52,952 --> 00:24:57,152
I just... I don't know where he is.

391
00:24:57,757 --> 00:25:00,550
This area really was the Wild West.

392
00:25:00,551 --> 00:25:04,063
I keep uncovering more and more
violence surrounding this location.

393
00:25:04,064 --> 00:25:07,189
During my research, I discovered
that the Johnson County War

394
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,303
was one of the biggest events
in Buffalo, Wyoming, history.

395
00:25:10,304 --> 00:25:12,438
So, I called a local historian.

396
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:18,339
She says the Occidental Hotel was
right in the middle of the conflict.

397
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:26,641
During my research, I
came across probably one

398
00:25:26,642 --> 00:25:29,084
of the biggest events that
happened in Buffalo's history.

399
00:25:29,085 --> 00:25:30,575
What can you tell me?

400
00:25:30,576 --> 00:25:36,229
Well, in 1892, there were a lot of large
cattle operations over the whole state.

401
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,077
And homesteaders started to move in,

402
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:41,701
and those homesteaders were disrupting
these large cattle operations.

403
00:25:41,702 --> 00:25:44,629
And the Wyoming Stock
Growers Association,

404
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:49,907
they actually created a hit list,
and they actually hired these men...

405
00:25:49,908 --> 00:25:51,994
About 50 gunmen to come through,

406
00:25:51,995 --> 00:25:56,928
and murder these people and
clear them out of the land.

407
00:25:56,929 --> 00:26:00,686
- And they became known as the Invaders.
- So, these guys were like mercenaries.

408
00:26:00,687 --> 00:26:02,455
- Exactly.
- So, what happens then?

409
00:26:02,456 --> 00:26:04,359
The townspeople learned
what was going on,

410
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,792
and they actually met at
the Occidental Saloon...

411
00:26:06,793 --> 00:26:09,741
And came to arms, came
together as a force.

412
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:15,642
And moved south out of town
and met them here at this ranch.

413
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,082
There's a lot of movement of people.

414
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:23,863
They're talking about a threat.

415
00:26:24,103 --> 00:26:26,819
There's another place
that they have to go.

416
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,791
I want to say they're, like um...

417
00:26:29,792 --> 00:26:32,258
In the military.

418
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:34,330
So, how does this whole mess end?

419
00:26:34,331 --> 00:26:37,121
It culminated in a three-day standoff.

420
00:26:37,122 --> 00:26:42,004
There were around 3,000 rounds
exchanged and nobody was actually killed.

421
00:26:42,005 --> 00:26:43,639
You're kidding.

422
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,274
The cavalry actually
rode in and saved the day.

423
00:26:47,275 --> 00:26:49,254
Well, they must have
been annoyed by that.

424
00:26:49,255 --> 00:26:51,447
This is a police action.
This is not a military thing.

425
00:26:51,448 --> 00:26:55,503
Exactly. But when the cavalry
rode in, everything just stopped.

426
00:26:55,504 --> 00:26:57,825
Even the townspeople must have
said, "we, better back off."

427
00:26:57,826 --> 00:27:01,438
I would think so. I know I would.

428
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:02,973
They're looking for, like, men.

429
00:27:02,974 --> 00:27:05,775
I think they're supposed to
arrest them or something like that.

430
00:27:05,776 --> 00:27:08,252
It's a dangerous mission.

431
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:13,016
They're all pretty equally pissed
about being assigned to this.

432
00:27:13,017 --> 00:27:15,822
- You know, this is beneath them.
- Okay.

433
00:27:15,823 --> 00:27:17,435
Do you know when this was?

434
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:19,896
1890s, 1880s.

435
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,467
There's yelling. There's panic.

436
00:27:26,468 --> 00:27:30,188
Ugh, geez. I don't feel good.

437
00:27:53,561 --> 00:27:56,370
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

438
00:27:56,371 --> 00:27:58,461
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

439
00:27:58,462 --> 00:28:00,965
and our clients for the first time.

440
00:28:00,966 --> 00:28:03,370
Amy, I'd like you to meet Dawn and Dave.

441
00:28:03,371 --> 00:28:06,072
They are the owners of this hotel.

442
00:28:06,073 --> 00:28:08,783
Dawn's put her blood and
sweat into this place.

443
00:28:08,784 --> 00:28:12,413
There's always been activity here,
but it's picked up a lot lately.

444
00:28:12,414 --> 00:28:15,922
Their employees are scared to work
here and their guests are having issues.

445
00:28:15,923 --> 00:28:17,606
Some of them are even
running out of here.

446
00:28:17,607 --> 00:28:21,383
They're barely getting by as it
is, and they really need our help,

447
00:28:21,384 --> 00:28:24,180
to find out what's going on
here to try to save the business.

448
00:28:24,181 --> 00:28:26,442
So, with that, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy

449
00:28:26,443 --> 00:28:31,303
and have her start
telling us about her walk.

450
00:28:32,857 --> 00:28:38,379
Where I started my walk, I met
this really grumpy old lady.

451
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:44,280
There's one room that she hates,
which is the kitchen upstairs.

452
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:50,978
Sometimes she gets confused and gets
really upset and kind of, like, flips out.

453
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,372
She moves a lot of things around.

454
00:28:54,373 --> 00:28:58,343
Basically, she wants
to kind of make a point.

455
00:28:58,344 --> 00:28:59,732
Makes sense.

456
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:03,123
I mean, the housekeeping is always
finding things moved to different,

457
00:29:03,124 --> 00:29:04,207
areas, so that makes sense.

458
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:07,312
Oh, furniture's moved
and mirrors are moved.

459
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:12,627
And you'll find pictures tipped
when nobody's been in there.

460
00:29:12,628 --> 00:29:17,165
I purposely did not restore
that room as a bedroom,

461
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:21,029
or a guest room because
the activity was so strong,

462
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:24,305
I felt my guests could not sleep there.

463
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:26,290
Interesting. Wow.

464
00:29:26,291 --> 00:29:30,847
Because I think she wants things, you
know, completely the way they were.

465
00:29:30,848 --> 00:29:33,831
So, it just irritates
her that it's not...

466
00:29:33,832 --> 00:29:37,672
Being used the way that it was.

467
00:29:40,189 --> 00:29:42,357
Well, what else did you see?

468
00:29:42,358 --> 00:29:44,209
I saw...

469
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:47,895
This really interesting
residual incident.

470
00:29:47,896 --> 00:29:52,585
A residual haunting is something
that is captured by the environment

471
00:29:52,586 --> 00:29:54,936
and played back like a movie.

472
00:29:54,937 --> 00:29:56,685
So, there were these men.

473
00:29:56,686 --> 00:30:01,846
They were arguing about
this mission they were on.

474
00:30:01,971 --> 00:30:07,458
I thought that they were in government
or military, something of that nature.

475
00:30:07,459 --> 00:30:11,227
And their mission was
to find a group of men.

476
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:13,302
They were supposed to arrest them.

477
00:30:13,303 --> 00:30:14,157
Huh.

478
00:30:14,158 --> 00:30:16,584
The other thing that was really...

479
00:30:16,585 --> 00:30:22,386
Upsetting to them was that this particular
mission was way beneath their job titles.

480
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:25,233
Because they were prestigious men.

481
00:30:25,234 --> 00:30:29,015
I got this was between
the 1880s or 1890s.

482
00:30:29,016 --> 00:30:31,789
That's incredible.

483
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:34,570
The reason I say that is because,

484
00:30:34,571 --> 00:30:37,753
this was one of the biggest events
in Buffalo, Wyoming, history.

485
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:40,277
I'm talking about the
Johnson County War.

486
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:42,117
You had wealthy cattle ranchers here

487
00:30:42,118 --> 00:30:45,174
who were upset that people
were settling on their land.

488
00:30:45,175 --> 00:30:49,242
So, what they did go and do is
they hired a bunch of mercenaries...

489
00:30:49,243 --> 00:30:52,363
Known as the Invaders.

490
00:30:54,412 --> 00:31:00,312
They hired these guys to get rid of and
kill the people that were settling here.

491
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:08,176
And then the cavalry was brought in by
the government to arrest the Invaders.

492
00:31:08,177 --> 00:31:10,345
So, they surround these guys on a ranch.

493
00:31:10,346 --> 00:31:13,700
3,000 rounds are exchanged.

494
00:31:13,701 --> 00:31:16,618
But believe it or not,
nobody gets killed.

495
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:19,287
- Oh, my gosh!
- Yeah. It's amazing.

496
00:31:19,288 --> 00:31:20,745
What year was that?

497
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:24,318
1892. So, you got the time right.

498
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:26,894
These guys were from the 6th
Cavalry from what I understand,

499
00:31:26,895 --> 00:31:28,696
which was a prestigious unit.

500
00:31:28,697 --> 00:31:32,233
Makes sense that they would think
it would be beneath them to do this.

501
00:31:32,234 --> 00:31:34,035
Is this who you think you saw?

502
00:31:34,036 --> 00:31:36,196
Possibly.

503
00:31:36,572 --> 00:31:39,133
All I know is, I saw a
group of men in uniform

504
00:31:39,134 --> 00:31:42,871
who resented the mission
they were sent to complete.

505
00:31:42,872 --> 00:31:46,772
They wanted to be someplace else.

506
00:31:48,551 --> 00:31:51,186
So, what else is going on?

507
00:31:51,187 --> 00:31:56,524
The grumpy old lady told me that
there was only one suicide here.

508
00:31:56,525 --> 00:32:00,709
And she said that it was
really sad and tragic...

509
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:04,339
But also a real inconvenience
for a lot of people.

510
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:09,140
It was a girl and there
were drugs involved.

511
00:32:09,464 --> 00:32:12,652
The confusing thing
was, then I came up here.

512
00:32:12,653 --> 00:32:14,776
There were people running
and they said that a young

513
00:32:14,777 --> 00:32:18,051
man had hung himself in one
of the rooms or something.

514
00:32:18,052 --> 00:32:20,905
It didn't make sense, because she
said there was only one suicide,

515
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:24,252
and so that kind of meant
to me there were two.

516
00:32:24,253 --> 00:32:27,855
I might be able to clear up. She may
have been right about the suicide.

517
00:32:27,856 --> 00:32:30,725
- Okay.
- But it didn't actually happen here.

518
00:32:30,726 --> 00:32:33,961
So I'm gonna hold off on that until I
hear a little bit more about your walk.

519
00:32:33,962 --> 00:32:36,965
Now, there was a hanging
here, but it wasn't a suicide.

520
00:32:36,966 --> 00:32:37,967
It wasn't?

521
00:32:37,968 --> 00:32:39,934
- Wasn't a suicide.
- Okay.

522
00:32:39,935 --> 00:32:44,880
Now, the hotel was a temporary
Courthouse from 1884 to 1886.

523
00:32:44,881 --> 00:32:49,410
Before it was torn down and rebuilt in
1900, a murder trial took place here.

524
00:32:49,411 --> 00:32:55,311
A guy by the name of Bill Booth murdered
a person that actually was the cook here.

525
00:32:56,164 --> 00:33:00,183
The cook had enlisted him to
provide him with venison meat.

526
00:33:00,184 --> 00:33:03,391
They got into an argument, and then
he bludgeoned him to death with an ax.

527
00:33:03,392 --> 00:33:05,460
Oh, my gosh!

528
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:07,457
He was sentenced to death.

529
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:11,778
But this is the kicker... this is him.

530
00:33:15,523 --> 00:33:19,208
Right before he dies, he admits
to killing his wife and two kids...

531
00:33:19,209 --> 00:33:20,642
Wow.

532
00:33:20,643 --> 00:33:23,081
And killing at least 12 other
people that he could remember.

533
00:33:23,082 --> 00:33:25,542
Oh, my gosh!

534
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,734
He was hung right here behind the hotel.

535
00:33:30,735 --> 00:33:32,595
Wow.

536
00:33:36,308 --> 00:33:38,844
So, how'd the rest of your walk go?

537
00:33:38,845 --> 00:33:42,338
When I came in this
room, I saw this really...

538
00:33:42,339 --> 00:33:45,399
Creepy-looking... Guy.

539
00:33:45,868 --> 00:33:50,428
Very tall, all in
shadow, but very solid.

540
00:33:50,439 --> 00:33:55,179
And I think that he's
the main issue here.

541
00:33:56,545 --> 00:33:58,925
He's very negative.

542
00:33:58,926 --> 00:34:02,785
He is a very, very strong presence here.

543
00:34:02,786 --> 00:34:08,323
Once of his biggest things
is he absolutely hates women.

544
00:34:08,324 --> 00:34:11,476
Hates them with a passion.

545
00:34:11,477 --> 00:34:16,195
He also grabbed me by the back of the
neck and was squeezing really hard.

546
00:34:16,196 --> 00:34:20,673
And this is something he likes to do to
kind of assert dominance, like an animal.

547
00:34:20,674 --> 00:34:25,306
He bullies people by grabbing
them, trying to strangle them.

548
00:34:25,307 --> 00:34:29,989
And he also tries to chase
people out of the hotel.

549
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:34,148
On the front staircase here, there
was a gentleman coming up the stairs.

550
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:39,001
As I approached him coming down
the stairs, he just froze solid.

551
00:34:39,002 --> 00:34:42,194
And was just literally white.

552
00:34:42,195 --> 00:34:44,659
He said to me, "you did not see that?"

553
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:48,128
- I said, "what?"
- He said, "it passed right through me."

554
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:50,043
And I said, "what passed through you?"

555
00:34:50,044 --> 00:34:53,634
And he said, "it was a light
passed right through me."

556
00:34:53,635 --> 00:34:56,932
And he said, "I need to leave."

557
00:34:56,933 --> 00:34:59,757
We had a guest that checked
in, and at 3:30 in the

558
00:34:59,758 --> 00:35:02,858
morning he picked up our house
phone and he was screaming

559
00:35:02,859 --> 00:35:06,797
that things were flying around his
room, things were falling off the walls.

560
00:35:06,798 --> 00:35:10,098
And he was out of here.

561
00:35:10,686 --> 00:35:14,875
I interviewed two former employees
from here that were pretty young girls.

562
00:35:14,876 --> 00:35:16,800
And talking to them, I
felt like, you know, like,

563
00:35:16,801 --> 00:35:18,990
something's picking on these kids.

564
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,793
That's not good.

565
00:35:20,794 --> 00:35:26,434
It's like he's all about creeping up
on people, catching them off guard.

566
00:35:26,435 --> 00:35:31,439
So, I did do a sketch of,
like, kind of a situation...

567
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,780
That I perceived of him
kind of intimidating a male.

568
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:41,969
He's wearing a cowboy hat,
jeans, and cowboy boots.

569
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,672
He's...

570
00:35:43,673 --> 00:35:45,586
60 to 65.

571
00:35:45,587 --> 00:35:48,227
And he's tall.

572
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,552
Wow.

573
00:35:54,963 --> 00:35:58,023
Take a look at that.

574
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:01,527
Oh, wow.

575
00:36:17,586 --> 00:36:21,217
So, I did do a sketch of a situation...

576
00:36:21,218 --> 00:36:26,258
Um, that I perceived of
him intimidating a male.

577
00:36:32,301 --> 00:36:34,161
Wow.

578
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:37,230
Take a look at that.

579
00:36:40,248 --> 00:36:42,408
Oh, wow.

580
00:36:42,584 --> 00:36:45,409
I'd like him to go away.

581
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:51,310
I just can't give up, because
this is such a special place.

582
00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:58,304
Now, seeing that sketch, I
mean, how's that make you feel?

583
00:36:58,305 --> 00:37:00,585
Frightened.

584
00:37:01,049 --> 00:37:05,240
I felt very drawn to this building
the moment I walked into it.

585
00:37:05,241 --> 00:37:09,021
But it's been so hard for me.

586
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,893
Yeah, you even said that to me,

587
00:37:10,894 --> 00:37:15,782
that your life's been like
hell since you started here.

588
00:37:15,783 --> 00:37:17,703
Yeah.

589
00:37:19,997 --> 00:37:22,765
Now, did you get a sense of
who this guy might have been?

590
00:37:22,766 --> 00:37:26,901
He obviously liked to hurt
women when he was alive.

591
00:37:26,902 --> 00:37:32,351
He likes to try as much
as he can to hurt them now.

592
00:37:32,352 --> 00:37:37,556
He was completely out of his mind,
had no sense of wrong or right,

593
00:37:37,557 --> 00:37:42,957
and I definitely felt that
he was a rapist of women.

594
00:37:46,972 --> 00:37:49,235
One of the former
owners of this hotel...

595
00:37:49,236 --> 00:37:52,596
- He was a rapist.
- Oh.

596
00:37:52,906 --> 00:37:58,102
His name was Fred Waegele, and he
owned this place from 1906 to 1917.

597
00:37:58,103 --> 00:38:01,813
He was about 60 years old and
he had a son around 20, 21,

598
00:38:01,814 --> 00:38:05,248
who married a girl
named Marion who was 17.

599
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:11,129
He repeatedly raped his
daughter-in-law over and over again.

600
00:38:11,691 --> 00:38:13,727
But she got revenge.

601
00:38:13,728 --> 00:38:15,703
Oh, boy.

602
00:38:15,704 --> 00:38:21,166
He had rheumatism, and he was
getting mail-away medicine for it.

603
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:25,470
So, she decided she was gonna mail
him some medicine, and she did.

604
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:27,539
She mailed him some cyanide.

605
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,208
Oh, my.

606
00:38:29,209 --> 00:38:32,121
- And he took it.
- Oh.

607
00:38:32,122 --> 00:38:36,148
And he died a nice, slow,
painful death, which he deserved.

608
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:40,835
Now, about a year later,
authorities questioned her about it.

609
00:38:40,836 --> 00:38:43,640
And she confesses to the whole thing.

610
00:38:43,641 --> 00:38:45,501
Wow.

611
00:38:46,584 --> 00:38:49,597
- Now, you had mentioned suicide.
- Mm-hmm.

612
00:38:49,598 --> 00:38:52,822
This confession took place at her home.

613
00:38:52,823 --> 00:38:55,949
She excused herself for a few
minutes as the detectives were there,

614
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:59,942
and she went in the next room and she
killed herself in the same manner...

615
00:38:59,943 --> 00:39:01,465
Oh, no.

616
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:03,490
Using cyanide.

617
00:39:03,491 --> 00:39:07,211
- That's just awful.
- It is.

618
00:39:07,605 --> 00:39:10,762
Now, do you think this
could be the rapist?

619
00:39:10,763 --> 00:39:15,743
Yeah, more than likely
that may be our culprit.

620
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,777
So, he's still hating women.

621
00:39:17,778 --> 00:39:22,275
Oh, yeah. I mean he still
wants to do what he was doing.

622
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:28,176
He'd like to be raping them, not
just fondling, touching, or grabbing.

623
00:39:29,196 --> 00:39:32,462
Best to get rid of him
before he figures it out.

624
00:39:32,463 --> 00:39:34,596
Will he be able to soon?

625
00:39:34,597 --> 00:39:36,510
Well, I mean, he's
definitely working on it.

626
00:39:36,511 --> 00:39:39,332
- He's working on it?
- Yeah.

627
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:41,913
He's evolving.

628
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,315
We laid a lot of
information down for you.

629
00:39:52,316 --> 00:39:54,826
Big question is, are you guys
gonna be able to run this hotel

630
00:39:54,827 --> 00:39:57,953
in a safe manner for
yourselves, your employees...

631
00:39:57,954 --> 00:39:59,943
Most importantly, for your guests?

632
00:39:59,944 --> 00:40:05,844
With that, I'm gonna turn it
over to Amy to get an answer.

633
00:40:07,631 --> 00:40:12,105
Because of the amount
of residual energy...

634
00:40:12,106 --> 00:40:16,628
I think it would be best if
you get a residual cleansing.

635
00:40:16,629 --> 00:40:22,314
So, you need to find a psychic
or a Shaman or a Wiccan.

636
00:40:22,315 --> 00:40:27,250
The second thing you need to do
is have that same individual...

637
00:40:27,251 --> 00:40:30,553
Do a protection ceremony for you.

638
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:31,869
What is that?

639
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:35,489
Well, once you're done cleansing
this place, you have a clean slate.

640
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,460
You want to kind of keep it clean.

641
00:40:37,461 --> 00:40:39,045
Okay.

642
00:40:39,046 --> 00:40:43,006
Then, to get rid of the rapist...

643
00:40:43,892 --> 00:40:46,502
You need to find a male medium...

644
00:40:46,503 --> 00:40:50,038
A strong Alpha male, definitely.

645
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:51,812
Why an Alpha male?

646
00:40:51,813 --> 00:40:55,757
A lot of men who bully women
are usually cowards at heart.

647
00:40:55,758 --> 00:40:57,181
- Mm-hmm.
- And weak.

648
00:40:57,182 --> 00:41:00,477
And if you get a real man in here...

649
00:41:00,478 --> 00:41:03,538
He's gonna bow down.

650
00:41:05,014 --> 00:41:08,201
And as far as the grumpy old lady...

651
00:41:08,202 --> 00:41:11,793
I think just taking that room and
putting it back to a guest room,

652
00:41:11,794 --> 00:41:15,634
will make her a lot less noisy.

653
00:41:16,938 --> 00:41:19,283
Now the big question.

654
00:41:19,284 --> 00:41:22,738
Are you gonna listen to what Amy says?

655
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:25,107
I am concerned about Dawn.

656
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:28,213
But this is overwhelming
to me, for sure.

657
00:41:28,214 --> 00:41:32,042
So, I'm still absorbing it, and
I have to think through this.

658
00:41:32,043 --> 00:41:34,717
Okay. I like your honest answer.

659
00:41:34,718 --> 00:41:38,829
Now, Dawn, you're gonna
follow through with this?

660
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,530
- I am.
- Okay.

661
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,996
It's time.

662
00:41:45,997 --> 00:41:48,021
- I'd like my life back.
- Yeah.

663
00:41:48,022 --> 00:41:49,942
Yeah.

664
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:54,704
The evil man who attacked
me is extremely dangerous.

665
00:41:54,705 --> 00:41:59,375
Even if Dave chooses not to help,
Dawn should really follow my advice,

666
00:41:59,376 --> 00:42:01,459
or he could do a lot of damage.

667
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:07,360
Not only to the hotel, but also
to its employees and guests.
