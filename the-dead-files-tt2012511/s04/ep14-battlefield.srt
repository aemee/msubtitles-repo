1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:10,855 --> 00:00:15,415
This thing wants to make
someone here go nuts.

3
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,784
Whatever's happening
here is destroying us.

4
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:19,286
Oh, boy.

5
00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:21,655
He says, ha ha. I've got you, [Bleep].

6
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:23,857
That's got to scare the hell
out of you, I would think.

7
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:27,361
He'll say, get out.
It's my house. Leave.

8
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:29,683
It's not something you
want to [Bleep] with.

9
00:00:29,684 --> 00:00:31,174
You telling me the truth?

10
00:00:31,175 --> 00:00:33,738
It made a believer out of me.

11
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:37,819
It's this sick, twisted environment.

12
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:41,850
They're being watched.

13
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:44,869
My name is Amy Allan.

14
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,072
This thing likes death.

15
00:00:47,073 --> 00:00:48,587
I see dead people.

16
00:00:48,588 --> 00:00:50,340
This thing's, like, a monster.

17
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,477
I speak to dead people.

18
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:54,011
And he's pissed off now.

19
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,531
And they speak to me.

20
00:00:55,532 --> 00:00:57,213
His head was cracked.

21
00:00:57,214 --> 00:01:00,318
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

22
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:02,442
This guy was murdered.

23
00:01:02,443 --> 00:01:03,796
I rely on my partner.

24
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,956
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

25
00:01:06,957 --> 00:01:09,727
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

26
00:01:09,728 --> 00:01:13,064
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

27
00:01:13,065 --> 00:01:14,397
You saw her?

28
00:01:14,398 --> 00:01:15,733
It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:15,734 --> 00:01:16,907
Why would you stay here?

30
00:01:16,908 --> 00:01:19,033
But Steve and I never speak...

31
00:01:19,034 --> 00:01:20,992
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:20,993 --> 00:01:22,399
Until the very end.

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,257
Stop it.

34
00:01:24,258 --> 00:01:26,091
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

35
00:01:26,092 --> 00:01:28,713
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

36
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,148
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:34,889
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

38
00:01:49,168 --> 00:01:54,372
When Amy and I take on a case, our
paths never cross until the very end.

39
00:01:54,373 --> 00:01:59,910
I interview living witnesses and uncover
secrets behind the property's past.

40
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:03,114
While Amy communicates with the dead.

41
00:02:03,115 --> 00:02:08,686
When we're done, we meet up and reveal
our findings to our clients and each other.

42
00:02:08,687 --> 00:02:12,890
I'm in Flint, Michigan, one of the
most violent cities in all of America.

43
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:15,891
I'm heading over to meet with a
family who's being tormented by

44
00:02:15,892 --> 00:02:19,997
the type of violence that would
never show up on the FBI stats.

45
00:02:19,998 --> 00:02:24,281
Kathy, the mom, says her family of
seven are scared for their lives.

46
00:02:24,282 --> 00:02:29,202
And she thinks Amy and
I are their last hope.

47
00:02:39,485 --> 00:02:41,073
Before Amy arrives,

48
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:44,389
I need to remove anything that
could influence her findings.

49
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,218
It's clear from all these photographs
that a large family lives here.

50
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:50,857
So I need to carefully
conceal any evidence of this.

51
00:02:50,858 --> 00:02:56,498
Only then will the location
be ready for tonight's walk.

52
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,921
I'm hearing growls.

53
00:03:19,368 --> 00:03:22,769
It's, like, not an
animal. It's not human.

54
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,890
It's very, very dark.

55
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,000
This was brought here on purpose.

56
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,100
Yeah, there's pretty bad [Bleep] here.

57
00:03:49,488 --> 00:03:52,390
Kathy, you sounded
really upset on the phone.

58
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:54,659
Things are pretty bad
here, it sounds like.

59
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,093
Yes.

60
00:03:56,094 --> 00:03:59,297
We're seeing apparitions.
We're getting attacked.

61
00:03:59,298 --> 00:04:02,165
- And who do you live here with?
- My husband and five kids.

62
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,402
Five years, we've been here.

63
00:04:04,403 --> 00:04:09,123
There's people being scratched,
clawed, things thrown at.

64
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:13,264
And it hits the kids extremely hard.

65
00:04:14,018 --> 00:04:19,058
- You okay?
- Yeah. Just... it's a hard subject.

66
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:21,209
I imagine it would be.

67
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,055
I feel like I'm a bad mother.

68
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:26,559
I mean, I didn't bring
them into the world,

69
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,166
to have something I
cannot see pick on them.

70
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:31,529
How can I defend that?

71
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,599
Have you ever done
anything to try to stop it?

72
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,715
We've had investigators come in.

73
00:04:35,716 --> 00:04:39,877
We've done cleansing of the house.
We've done sea salt around the yard.

74
00:04:39,878 --> 00:04:41,798
Okay.

75
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,909
But we've done
everything unsuccessfully.

76
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,530
And they've even tried
an exorcism on me.

77
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:53,351
- Oh, boy.
- And nothing's helping.

78
00:04:53,352 --> 00:04:55,272
Okay.

79
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:04,774
Whether it's people now or
people that were here before,

80
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:08,271
you know, somebody was
definitely into some...

81
00:05:08,272 --> 00:05:09,934
Dark stuff.

82
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:10,956
What do you mean?

83
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:14,136
They're into the paranormal but...

84
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:17,705
It seems like they're
uneducated about it.

85
00:05:17,706 --> 00:05:21,980
Like, taking pictures and
video, like they're really...

86
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:25,281
Trying to figure it out.

87
00:05:31,256 --> 00:05:33,416
Oh, boy.

88
00:05:41,335 --> 00:05:43,495
Okay, so, what's going on in here?

89
00:05:43,496 --> 00:05:48,285
We see black masses, and, I mean,
there's a lot of black masses in here.

90
00:05:48,286 --> 00:05:50,404
So, what shapes and sizes
are we talking about?

91
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:52,562
Well, some of them come in human forms.

92
00:05:52,563 --> 00:05:55,465
A lot of the times, it's a headless man.

93
00:05:55,466 --> 00:05:59,817
He'll say, get out. It's
mine. My house. Leave.

94
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,751
But some of them are just widespread.

95
00:06:01,752 --> 00:06:05,164
I mean, it's like they
spread across the wall.

96
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,446
And it's no reflection from
outside or anything like that?

97
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:08,423
No. No.

98
00:06:08,424 --> 00:06:10,828
Well, that's got to scare the
hell out of you, I would think.

99
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,349
Yes, it does.

100
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:24,739
So, there is something that runs.

101
00:06:25,944 --> 00:06:29,815
It went right through the wall,
as if this wall's not here.

102
00:06:29,816 --> 00:06:33,232
- Was this the thing that was growling?
- Yes.

103
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:37,087
It's not something you
want to [Bleep] with.

104
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:39,602
I'm still not sure what this thing is.

105
00:06:39,603 --> 00:06:43,594
But I get the feeling that it's out to
harm the people living in this house.

106
00:06:43,595 --> 00:06:47,242
I think that some people have
seen it, like, a blackness.

107
00:06:47,243 --> 00:06:52,163
But it could come to
them completely different.

108
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:56,040
It definitely morphs.

109
00:06:56,041 --> 00:07:01,321
I just saw it, like, turn
into a big spider thing.

110
00:07:06,084 --> 00:07:09,084
Very, very not good.

111
00:07:11,924 --> 00:07:14,056
We're all close-knit,
very close-knit,

112
00:07:14,057 --> 00:07:17,428
but when we're here, we're
at each other's throats.

113
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:21,437
We're all fighting, and,
I mean, this is not us.

114
00:07:21,438 --> 00:07:23,257
How were the kids before they came here?

115
00:07:23,258 --> 00:07:26,678
They were happy. I mean,
everybody was normal.

116
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,996
- So their personalities took a change?
- Yes.

117
00:07:29,997 --> 00:07:34,484
My one son, he got mad and
punched a hole in the wall.

118
00:07:34,485 --> 00:07:35,995
That's not like him.

119
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:37,496
Wow.

120
00:07:37,497 --> 00:07:41,391
But as long as we're off this
property, we're back to normal.

121
00:07:41,392 --> 00:07:44,324
We can sort through what just happened.

122
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:47,865
So, how long once you're off the
property do you start feeling better?

123
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:49,399
Just step off the property.

124
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,400
- That's it?
- Yes.

125
00:07:52,937 --> 00:07:57,557
Whatever's happening
here is destroying us.

126
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:03,680
I'm hearing a lot of fighting...

127
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:06,261
Like, constant.

128
00:08:07,605 --> 00:08:10,521
Um, screaming and yelling.

129
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:16,042
So I'm thinking that's a
direct effect of this thing.

130
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:22,683
I do see it, like, under the beds...

131
00:08:22,684 --> 00:08:28,444
Like, slithering like a little
spider going under the beds.

132
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:36,308
I think that it wants to make
someone here or many, several go...

133
00:08:38,322 --> 00:08:40,242
Nuts.

134
00:08:46,524 --> 00:08:49,125
So, Kathy, why would
you bring me out here?

135
00:08:49,126 --> 00:08:52,028
There was a time that I went
out here to talk to my husband.

136
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:56,905
He was out in the garage. And in the
middle of talking to him, I felt a hand...

137
00:08:56,906 --> 00:09:00,403
Reach around my throat,
and I couldn't breathe.

138
00:09:00,404 --> 00:09:02,142
I couldn't talk, couldn't nothing.

139
00:09:02,143 --> 00:09:06,377
When I come running out of the
garage, I wound up vomiting out here,

140
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:09,913
but I felt the release of the
hand that was around my throat.

141
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:11,147
Wow.

142
00:09:11,148 --> 00:09:14,217
That's probably the most physical
interaction I've heard about.

143
00:09:14,218 --> 00:09:17,888
I haven't even told you the worst of it.

144
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:20,857
One night, laying in
bed, I was grabbed...

145
00:09:20,858 --> 00:09:24,025
You know, I mean, sexually grabbed.

146
00:09:24,026 --> 00:09:29,522
It woke me up out of sleep, and, of
course, I check on my one son, Mikey.

147
00:09:29,523 --> 00:09:33,421
And I looked over, and his leg...

148
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:37,474
Somebody had his leg and
was pulling him off the bed.

149
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:39,498
I mean, he was literally
going from his pillow,

150
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:42,758
down his bed and about
to fall onto the floor.

151
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:45,082
What were they gonna do to him?

152
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,527
What's the next step from this?

153
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:49,185
How do you live like that?

154
00:09:49,186 --> 00:09:53,440
It's not living. You're
just going day-by-day.

155
00:09:53,441 --> 00:09:57,894
It may sound strange, but when you're off
the property, you just pray for a fire.

156
00:09:57,895 --> 00:09:59,254
It'll be the relief.

157
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:05,155
I think it'll be the sigh, you know, that
you can actually breathe a little bit.

158
00:10:12,043 --> 00:10:14,584
I see this woman who...

159
00:10:14,585 --> 00:10:16,865
Is just...

160
00:10:17,815 --> 00:10:20,536
Like, caught in this.

161
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:24,597
She just sees everything in her life...

162
00:10:24,598 --> 00:10:28,659
Falling apart... like, not
sleeping, not really eating right.

163
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,649
And she's kind of the one
who takes care of everybody.

164
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,446
Okay.

165
00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:35,455
And she's tough, but...

166
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:38,886
You know, she's broken
now. She's just broken.

167
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:44,675
Like, I think she's had thoughts
of burning down the house.

168
00:10:44,676 --> 00:10:47,436
It's pretty bad.

169
00:11:15,785 --> 00:11:17,956
- Zach, how old are you?
- 16.

170
00:11:17,957 --> 00:11:21,165
I was talking with mom she's telling me
about the things that are going on in the

171
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,810
house I wanted to talk to you to
find out what you're experiencing.

172
00:11:23,811 --> 00:11:29,211
- If anything.
- Well, I was scratched in the bedroom.

173
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:30,887
What do you mean? You got scratches?

174
00:11:30,888 --> 00:11:35,833
I had the word "leave"
scratched on my stomach.

175
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:37,334
- Leave, huh?
- Mm hmm.

176
00:11:37,335 --> 00:11:39,584
That sure as hell
does say that, does it?

177
00:11:39,585 --> 00:11:41,606
Now, you didn't do this yourself, right?

178
00:11:41,607 --> 00:11:43,193
- No, no.
- You telling me the truth?

179
00:11:43,194 --> 00:11:44,642
- Yes.
- Okay.

180
00:11:44,643 --> 00:11:46,561
What other experiences
are you having here?

181
00:11:46,562 --> 00:11:49,553
I woke up, and there was a
guy sitting on the toy chest,

182
00:11:49,554 --> 00:11:52,039
and he said, I can be a
real good friend for you.

183
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,151
Okay. Now, what did he look like?

184
00:11:54,152 --> 00:11:57,121
The first time he came, he
looked like a normal human.

185
00:11:57,122 --> 00:11:58,791
He was an old guy.

186
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:01,633
And the next night, he
started getting a little...

187
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:04,520
It looked like he was decomposing.

188
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:09,066
The next night, he got real
dark black, and he had no eyes.

189
00:12:09,067 --> 00:12:13,207
- And this was the same guy?
- Yes.

190
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:17,813
Things here have gotten pretty bad.

191
00:12:17,814 --> 00:12:23,714
I feel like it has made a consistent
contact with somebody here.

192
00:12:27,765 --> 00:12:31,218
It's probably tricking someone.

193
00:12:31,219 --> 00:12:37,119
Which obviously means that it can
do what scares you or bothers you.

194
00:12:40,938 --> 00:12:45,378
And it's like a babysitter or something.

195
00:12:46,584 --> 00:12:48,785
This entity is incredibly deceiving.

196
00:12:48,786 --> 00:12:54,686
It projects itself into anything it needs
to get close to the people in this house.

197
00:12:59,298 --> 00:13:02,178
It's a bad thing.

198
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:11,718
- Mike, I talked to Kathy.
- Okay.

199
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:13,706
I spoke with Zach. You
got a lot of problems here.

200
00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:14,567
Yeah.

201
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:17,161
I want to hear from you
what you're experiencing.

202
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:19,291
One day I was out here
working on the truck,

203
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:22,279
and pretty soon, something
hit me in the back.

204
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:28,180
I happened to look down to see what it
was, and it was a piece of broken concrete.

205
00:13:28,426 --> 00:13:31,079
Okay, you got no concrete on
the walls or the ceilings here.

206
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,845
- No.
- Anything else?

207
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:37,701
I had a one-inch wrench thrown at me, and
it hit me right in the middle of the back.

208
00:13:37,702 --> 00:13:39,435
- Now, were you in here alone?
- Yeah.

209
00:13:39,436 --> 00:13:42,105
- Do you keep the kids out of here?
- The kids were all in bed.

210
00:13:42,106 --> 00:13:43,687
What's your biggest fear?

211
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:47,622
Oh... my biggest fear is
somebody's really gonna get hurt.

212
00:13:47,623 --> 00:13:48,645
Right.

213
00:13:48,646 --> 00:13:52,795
My plan was, you know, for us to
get married and be happy, you know?

214
00:13:52,796 --> 00:13:56,809
And I wanted to start a
good life and take care...

215
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,990
Take good care of the
kids and everything, and...

216
00:13:58,991 --> 00:14:04,091
We come into here, and
everything just went down.

217
00:14:09,596 --> 00:14:14,576
So, there's been a lot
of chaos in this area.

218
00:14:15,974 --> 00:14:20,217
I think the thing is in
here quite frequently.

219
00:14:20,218 --> 00:14:23,761
And, I mean, it is interesting because
the thing doesn't like all this [Bleep].

220
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:29,419
Maybe because it doesn't look like
it did when it came here or something.

221
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,389
It makes it angry, and it
gets really, really physical...

222
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:39,210
Moving things very harshly
around, like it doesn't like it.

223
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:44,520
I'm trying to figure out
what this evil entity is,

224
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:48,721
and suddenly it reveals itself to me.

225
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:51,676
It's a Demon.

226
00:14:51,677 --> 00:14:56,398
And it creates this sick,
twisted environment for...

227
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,559
Everyone.

228
00:15:05,264 --> 00:15:07,586
Okay, Mike, why'd you
bring me in the bedroom?

229
00:15:07,587 --> 00:15:11,620
A lot of stuff going on in
here that's just not normal.

230
00:15:11,621 --> 00:15:12,481
Like what?

231
00:15:12,482 --> 00:15:15,138
- Blankets being pulled off.
- Okay.

232
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:18,405
And I've been shook awake.

233
00:15:18,406 --> 00:15:21,140
Your wife had told me you had a
lot of animals, could you be getting

234
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:24,238
touched at night, or the blankets
getting pulled, one of the animals?

235
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:25,865
- No.
- Why not?

236
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:27,701
We have the door locked at night.

237
00:15:27,702 --> 00:15:30,075
I mean, it's got to be a little
bit tough for your marriage.

238
00:15:30,076 --> 00:15:31,646
Yeah, it really is.

239
00:15:31,647 --> 00:15:34,240
We never fought like
this until we got here.

240
00:15:34,241 --> 00:15:38,344
There's been a couple of times that she's
actually threatened to just walk out.

241
00:15:38,345 --> 00:15:40,389
Has your personality
changed since you got here?

242
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,213
- Yeah, very.
- In what way?

243
00:15:42,214 --> 00:15:44,460
Real short fuse.

244
00:15:44,461 --> 00:15:49,477
And apparently, the guy that lived here,
he had a very short fuse, too, you know?

245
00:15:49,478 --> 00:15:51,208
You mean the guy that
lived here before you?

246
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:52,071
Yeah.

247
00:15:52,072 --> 00:15:54,363
What kind of a guy was he, do
you know anything about him?

248
00:15:54,364 --> 00:15:58,206
Um... all I know is what
his kids have told me.

249
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:02,087
He liked to throw things, and he drank.

250
00:16:02,088 --> 00:16:05,337
Okay, so, you say he was. I
mean, did he die, I assume?

251
00:16:05,338 --> 00:16:10,589
Yes, he died in the living room,
and they found him three days later.

252
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:15,722
And all the furniture stayed
behind, so we got his bed...

253
00:16:15,723 --> 00:16:17,656
Both of his dressers.

254
00:16:17,657 --> 00:16:19,351
- Is this his mattress, as well?
- Yes.

255
00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:22,087
So you're sleeping on this guy's
mattress and using his furniture.

256
00:16:22,088 --> 00:16:23,789
Yes.

257
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,090
Well, that's interesting.

258
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:33,760
I just see people fighting, and
this man comes in from the closet.

259
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:37,967
He says, ha ha. I've got you, [Bleep].

260
00:16:37,968 --> 00:16:42,468
And he, like, tries to sleep in the bed.

261
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,046
You feel, like, a poke,
and it just stays here.

262
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:51,349
Like, they feel him near them
talking, but there's no words.

263
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,452
Because it's all gurbley.

264
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:55,756
It looks like intestines
or brains are coming,

265
00:16:55,757 --> 00:16:58,270
like, out of their mouth or something.

266
00:16:58,271 --> 00:17:00,911
It's not good.

267
00:17:20,595 --> 00:17:23,059
It looks like intestines
or brains are coming,

268
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,217
like, out of their mouth or something.

269
00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:28,858
It's not good.

270
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,879
Mm.

271
00:17:34,908 --> 00:17:37,681
It's really hard, I can't...

272
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:43,262
Communicate because their
brains, literally, are scrambled.

273
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:52,058
They're not making any sense.

274
00:17:52,878 --> 00:17:55,409
I don't know if he's,
like, severely mentally ill.

275
00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:00,210
I can't get the thought
process out of him.

276
00:18:02,053 --> 00:18:05,100
Mike told me the previous
owner died right in the house.

277
00:18:05,101 --> 00:18:07,204
So I reached out to one of
his neighbors who knew him

278
00:18:07,205 --> 00:18:12,545
pretty well to see what
he could tell me about him.

279
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:21,314
Your neighbors across the street were
telling me about the previous owner,

280
00:18:21,315 --> 00:18:22,496
and that you knew him?

281
00:18:22,497 --> 00:18:24,889
Yeah. I used to call him old Wild Bill.

282
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,355
I understand he died in
the house. Is that right?

283
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:31,117
Yeah, there was a... there was a
woman there, she would cut the lawn,

284
00:18:31,118 --> 00:18:33,730
and she'd run errands for him,
and she had a key to the house.

285
00:18:33,731 --> 00:18:37,748
She hadn't heard from him in like two
or three days, and she opened up the...

286
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:41,213
The door there and found he had
passed away inside the house.

287
00:18:41,214 --> 00:18:43,804
Okay. Now, I was told... and
I don't know how true it is...

288
00:18:43,805 --> 00:18:46,032
That he had a mean side
to him. Is that true?

289
00:18:46,033 --> 00:18:49,912
Well, he could be. Yeah, if he
did a little bit of drinking there,

290
00:18:49,913 --> 00:18:52,376
he could get about half
mean and that, but uh...

291
00:18:52,377 --> 00:18:54,778
There was one time there the
kids had a swing in there,

292
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:56,380
and they're smoking cigarettes and that.

293
00:18:56,381 --> 00:18:59,769
He come out there just bellowing and
that and chased them down the road.

294
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,633
Okay.

295
00:19:00,634 --> 00:19:04,319
But after his wife passed away and
that, I think he started drinking more.

296
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,207
And I think he got a little
bit more cantankerous and that.

297
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,503
So, let me ask you something. How
did bill feel about his house itself?

298
00:19:12,504 --> 00:19:16,626
Well, they kept that place immaculate
there, his yard looked like a golf course.

299
00:19:16,627 --> 00:19:19,246
Inside the house,
everything was real nice.

300
00:19:19,247 --> 00:19:23,652
And very particular about the way
everything was and that, I know if uh...

301
00:19:23,653 --> 00:19:26,568
Anybody was in there and they was
messing with his tools, or anything,

302
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:29,623
he'd probably roll right over in his
grave, I believe that with all my heart.

303
00:19:29,624 --> 00:19:30,663
- You do?
- Yeah.

304
00:19:30,664 --> 00:19:32,584
Okay.

305
00:19:39,642 --> 00:19:43,242
Can you describe him at all?

306
00:19:43,346 --> 00:19:46,617
This person's white, male.

307
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:50,081
I feel like his body is frail.

308
00:19:50,082 --> 00:19:53,344
He's, like, very shattered.

309
00:19:53,345 --> 00:19:56,305
It's very weird. I don't know.

310
00:19:56,306 --> 00:20:01,561
The guy could have been on drugs, and it's
almost like it's a lost cause or something.

311
00:20:01,562 --> 00:20:06,842
This person is here most
of the time in this room.

312
00:20:09,885 --> 00:20:13,296
Now that I know there was a death
fairly recently in Kathy's house.

313
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:18,379
I need to dig deeper into the property's
history to see what else I can uncover.

314
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,344
Searching through the archives, I discover
that a little girl named Loretta Eschenweck

315
00:20:22,345 --> 00:20:27,985
died from a tragic accident
inside Kathy's home in 1936.

316
00:20:28,123 --> 00:20:33,127
But the death certificate
doesn't explain how it happened.

317
00:20:33,128 --> 00:20:35,444
I've managed to track
down the victim's nephew.

318
00:20:35,445 --> 00:20:40,065
And he says he can
tell me what happened.

319
00:20:44,506 --> 00:20:47,912
I understand your grandparents actually
lived in the house that I'm investigating.

320
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:48,933
Yes, they did.

321
00:20:48,934 --> 00:20:51,381
Do you have any idea how long
your family owned that house?

322
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:54,322
Uh, from 1931 to 1974.

323
00:20:54,323 --> 00:20:56,897
Okay, there was a tragedy there
where a little girl got killed.

324
00:20:56,898 --> 00:20:58,848
- Loretta.
- What can you tell me about that?

325
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:01,892
It was my Aunt. She was 4 years old.

326
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:05,866
I have a picture here of
Loretta and my Grandmother.

327
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:10,091
She was playing when my
Grandmother was doing the laundry,

328
00:21:10,092 --> 00:21:15,419
and then she fell into the
hot water the laundry was in.

329
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,441
That poor kid. I mean,
she must have suffered.

330
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:21,623
I think that she probably passed
from either, you know, infection...

331
00:21:21,624 --> 00:21:25,602
Or something that related back to it.

332
00:21:25,603 --> 00:21:27,184
She was an only child.

333
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,327
Right. She was the only
child. And they were young,

334
00:21:29,328 --> 00:21:31,836
just starting out their family,
and then the devastation.

335
00:21:31,837 --> 00:21:34,626
And then it took them quite
a few years to get over it.

336
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:38,887
But the memory was never lost of her.

337
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:59,799
I've traced the deed to this
property as far back as it will go,

338
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,905
but the history goes back even further.

339
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:06,800
I'm meeting with a local author who's
written a lot about the Flint area,

340
00:22:06,801 --> 00:22:12,701
and he says Kathy's property used to
be filled with tragedy and warfare.

341
00:22:19,934 --> 00:22:24,067
Turns out, the property I'm investigating
used to be Native American land.

342
00:22:24,068 --> 00:22:25,859
Pretty horrific stuff went on there.

343
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,451
What can you tell me about it?

344
00:22:27,452 --> 00:22:31,365
Well, this was the land of
the Saginaw Chippewa tribe.

345
00:22:31,366 --> 00:22:34,012
They were a very fierce,
very warlike tribe.

346
00:22:34,013 --> 00:22:37,071
The United States government
was terrified of these guys.

347
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:41,489
Most of the Saginaw Chippewa warriors
were very much aligned with the British.

348
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:47,378
Who were coming out of Canada to
fight the Americans in the War of 1812.

349
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:51,355
This is a picture of
United States troops.

350
00:22:51,356 --> 00:22:54,204
Okay, so, what happened with
them during the War of 1812?

351
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:56,648
The Native Americans
would take hostages.

352
00:22:56,649 --> 00:23:00,220
They would capture soldiers in
battle, swoop down on a settlement,

353
00:23:00,221 --> 00:23:05,099
and literally ransom them back to
white representatives for money.

354
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,276
So, let me ask you a question
about the American soldiers.

355
00:23:08,277 --> 00:23:10,942
When they were POWs, what
were they treated like?

356
00:23:10,943 --> 00:23:14,040
It would have been a very, very
tough thing to be a prisoner.

357
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:16,612
The winter season would have
been very, very difficult.

358
00:23:16,613 --> 00:23:18,643
Food would have been at a premium.

359
00:23:18,644 --> 00:23:23,984
There are accounts of people
being tortured to death.

360
00:23:28,525 --> 00:23:31,885
There's, like, a lot
of dead men over there.

361
00:23:31,886 --> 00:23:35,101
And there's, like, at
least ten white men.

362
00:23:35,102 --> 00:23:39,585
And they're all a mess,
and it's very, very muddy.

363
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:43,361
It's really weird, because
they really don't have anything.

364
00:23:43,362 --> 00:23:46,294
Their clothes are just kind of tattered.

365
00:23:46,295 --> 00:23:50,435
They have long, gray, wool coats on.

366
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,609
I think a lot of them are sick.

367
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:57,787
They haven't had, like,
proper meals in a long time.

368
00:23:57,788 --> 00:24:00,886
They're just, like, pretty miserable.

369
00:24:00,887 --> 00:24:05,387
I just think they're trying to get home.

370
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,733
So, what happens to my client's
property after the war's over?

371
00:24:09,734 --> 00:24:13,203
After the war ends, the
Indians are left high and dry.

372
00:24:13,204 --> 00:24:16,305
Now the British are
gone. They need money.

373
00:24:16,306 --> 00:24:18,065
And the only other way
they had to get money

374
00:24:18,066 --> 00:24:20,508
is to sell land to The United States.

375
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:23,661
And at that point, they're relying
very heavily on a fur trader,

376
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:27,951
who the Indians have known well now for
about 10, 12 years, and that's this guy.

377
00:24:27,952 --> 00:24:28,872
And who's this?

378
00:24:28,873 --> 00:24:31,421
That's Jacob Smith.
They think he's a friend.

379
00:24:31,422 --> 00:24:34,672
They literally turn to Smith
for advice but the government is

380
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:39,657
paying him to influence the
Indians to sign a treaty in 1819.

381
00:24:39,658 --> 00:24:42,622
They do. What Smith also manages to do,

382
00:24:42,623 --> 00:24:48,422
is to secure land for his kids in
a very, very questionable manner.

383
00:24:48,423 --> 00:24:54,323
And he does it by having Indian names for
his kids written into the treaty language.

384
00:24:54,765 --> 00:24:58,501
The land you're
investigating is Nondashemau.

385
00:24:58,502 --> 00:25:03,715
The Smith heirs claim that Maria
Stockton, Jacob Smith's youngest daughter.

386
00:25:03,716 --> 00:25:06,816
That she is Nondashemau,
that that's her Chippewa name,

387
00:25:06,817 --> 00:25:08,992
that her father's friends had given her.

388
00:25:08,993 --> 00:25:12,595
The property was written
into the U.S. law for her.

389
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:14,735
So it sounds like he
basically tricked them.

390
00:25:14,736 --> 00:25:17,510
He did. He manipulated things to have,

391
00:25:17,511 --> 00:25:22,431
land granted to his
white kids in that treaty.

392
00:25:29,046 --> 00:25:32,830
There were several entities
that stood out during my walk.

393
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,738
But what has me the most concerned,

394
00:25:34,739 --> 00:25:37,787
is the demonic Creature
that's able to change shape.

395
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:41,613
And what I saw was this young female...

396
00:25:41,614 --> 00:25:45,874
Light-brown hair, kind of pulled back.

397
00:25:46,402 --> 00:25:49,402
She's kneeling down.

398
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:54,550
And there's a child sitting facing her.

399
00:25:55,605 --> 00:26:01,505
On the wall, I would like there
to be the outline of just a shadow.

400
00:26:04,548 --> 00:26:07,668
Is this what you saw?

401
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:10,179
Yes.

402
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:38,070
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations.

403
00:26:38,071 --> 00:26:40,496
We're prepared to reveal
our findings to our clients,

404
00:26:40,497 --> 00:26:43,366
and each other for the first time.

405
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:46,612
Amy, I'd like you to
meet Mike and Kathy.

406
00:26:46,613 --> 00:26:49,712
They live here with their five children.

407
00:26:49,713 --> 00:26:51,464
We've done a lot of investigations,

408
00:26:51,465 --> 00:26:54,096
but I've never heard the stuff
that they're going through.

409
00:26:54,097 --> 00:26:59,840
They're actually afraid for their lives,
and they feel like we're their last hope.

410
00:26:59,841 --> 00:27:05,741
That being said, I'm gonna ask Amy to
tell us a little bit about her walk.

411
00:27:06,937 --> 00:27:12,775
So, I'm outside in the front
yard, and I saw these 10 men.

412
00:27:12,776 --> 00:27:14,423
They were all white.

413
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:19,178
All of them were wearing, like,
torn and tattered long, gray coats.

414
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,416
They didn't have food.

415
00:27:20,417 --> 00:27:24,687
I mean, they were a mess,
and they were very ill.

416
00:27:24,688 --> 00:27:26,595
That's interesting.

417
00:27:26,596 --> 00:27:29,633
During the War of 1812, the
land that your property sits on,

418
00:27:29,634 --> 00:27:33,328
used to belong to the
Chippewa Saginaw Indian tribes.

419
00:27:33,329 --> 00:27:37,405
During the war, they had sided with
the British, and they'd go out on raids.

420
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:41,836
And they would kidnap American
soldiers and civilians.

421
00:27:41,837 --> 00:27:44,373
The historian I had spoke
to said that these guys lived

422
00:27:44,374 --> 00:27:47,050
under the worst conditions
when they were hostages.

423
00:27:47,051 --> 00:27:48,440
Oh.

424
00:27:48,441 --> 00:27:50,246
Now, when you mentioned gray coats...

425
00:27:50,247 --> 00:27:52,506
Take a look at that.

426
00:27:52,507 --> 00:27:56,064
You see the uniform colors
on the American soldiers?

427
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:58,225
Oh, wow.

428
00:27:58,462 --> 00:28:01,830
Now, there's an interesting
character in this whole thing.

429
00:28:01,831 --> 00:28:05,478
A guy by the name of Jacob Smith...

430
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:08,737
Who used to be a fur
trader with the Indians.

431
00:28:08,738 --> 00:28:13,712
Now, they trusted Smith, so he convinced
the Native Americans to sign a treaty.

432
00:28:13,713 --> 00:28:18,301
With The United States government
for the land, but he tricked them.

433
00:28:18,302 --> 00:28:21,678
Your property, he took from the Indians.

434
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,352
He did this by giving
his kids Indian names,

435
00:28:24,353 --> 00:28:28,281
listing them as owners of
sections of land in the treaty.

436
00:28:28,282 --> 00:28:32,121
Take a look. This is
where your house is.

437
00:28:32,122 --> 00:28:35,720
He gave the property
the name Nondashemau.

438
00:28:35,721 --> 00:28:38,919
The Chippewa Indians, they
thought it was their land.

439
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,847
It actually was there for his daughter.

440
00:28:40,848 --> 00:28:42,365
Wow.

441
00:28:42,366 --> 00:28:44,996
As far as I'm concerned, he
really screwed the Indians.

442
00:28:44,997 --> 00:28:46,917
Whoa.

443
00:28:50,345 --> 00:28:52,751
When I came into the house...

444
00:28:52,752 --> 00:28:57,492
I saw an individual
jump out of the closet.

445
00:28:57,578 --> 00:29:00,816
And this was in the Master Bedroom.

446
00:29:00,817 --> 00:29:02,677
God.

447
00:29:02,961 --> 00:29:08,361
He laughed, and then he
said, I've got you, [Bleep].

448
00:29:08,676 --> 00:29:11,961
He tries to climb
into the bed and sleep.

449
00:29:11,962 --> 00:29:13,096
Oh.

450
00:29:13,097 --> 00:29:17,117
He was ripping covers off the bed.

451
00:29:18,437 --> 00:29:20,657
You okay?

452
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,303
That happens.

453
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:28,144
Several times, I've felt the
blankets being pulled off...

454
00:29:28,145 --> 00:29:31,085
And being grabbed...

455
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,839
Sexually.

456
00:29:36,884 --> 00:29:38,885
You've been shook, too, right?

457
00:29:38,886 --> 00:29:42,000
Yeah, it felt like somebody just...

458
00:29:42,001 --> 00:29:45,235
Grabbed a hold like this on my shoulder.

459
00:29:45,236 --> 00:29:48,060
And shook me right awake.

460
00:29:48,061 --> 00:29:49,921
Wow.

461
00:29:50,384 --> 00:29:53,386
What I did get was that he was white.

462
00:29:53,387 --> 00:29:57,614
And that he was on some kind
of substance, maybe drugs.

463
00:29:57,615 --> 00:30:02,235
And his body was very
frail when he died.

464
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:04,856
That's interesting you say that.

465
00:30:04,857 --> 00:30:09,303
The man that lived in your house before
you guys bought it was this guy named Bill.

466
00:30:09,304 --> 00:30:11,926
I talked to your neighbor about
him, who he was close with.

467
00:30:11,927 --> 00:30:14,956
Said he was cantankerous and half mean.

468
00:30:14,957 --> 00:30:17,070
Back in the '90s, his wife passed away,

469
00:30:17,071 --> 00:30:20,493
and from that time, he took a downward
spiral, started drinking heavily.

470
00:30:20,494 --> 00:30:22,629
Eventually, he wound up in a wheelchair.

471
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:25,990
He did die in the house.

472
00:30:26,767 --> 00:30:30,667
I got his death certificate here.

473
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:35,629
He died of basically pneumonia
and respiratory failure.

474
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:40,507
He was found after like
three days in the house.

475
00:30:40,508 --> 00:30:44,235
Some of that information you had.

476
00:30:44,236 --> 00:30:47,657
The odd part is, when they
bought the house, they bought...

477
00:30:47,658 --> 00:30:49,623
- Most of the furniture with it.
- Oh.

478
00:30:49,624 --> 00:30:51,891
And they're actually
sleeping on Bill's mattress.

479
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,126
Yes.

480
00:30:53,127 --> 00:30:55,262
- So...
- Oh, wow.

481
00:30:55,263 --> 00:30:57,664
I mean, I don't know if this
is the guy you saw, but...

482
00:30:57,665 --> 00:30:59,466
It's very possible.

483
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:03,470
Would them keeping his
furniture make things worse?

484
00:31:03,471 --> 00:31:07,585
Yeah, that's probably not a good thing.

485
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:10,118
Beds hold a lot of...

486
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,693
Residual energy.

487
00:31:12,694 --> 00:31:17,374
I'm not gonna be
settled until it's gone.

488
00:31:18,612 --> 00:31:20,887
So, what else is going
on with this walk?

489
00:31:20,888 --> 00:31:24,546
I felt like some of the
living in the house...

490
00:31:24,547 --> 00:31:27,260
Are trying to communicate with the dead.

491
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:31,444
I wasn't upset by this, and
usually I get really pissed.

492
00:31:31,445 --> 00:31:35,498
But I really felt like
these people were honestly

493
00:31:35,499 --> 00:31:38,771
just trying to figure
out what's going on.

494
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,231
Tell her about how you've
been trying to communicate.

495
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:46,359
A paranormal team came in, and
they've done EVPs and pictures, but...

496
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,664
It's unsuccessful so far.

497
00:31:49,665 --> 00:31:52,402
They've even done an
exorcism on me thinking that,

498
00:31:52,403 --> 00:31:56,423
maybe something was attached to me.

499
00:31:56,513 --> 00:32:00,197
It's very, very rare
that an individual...

500
00:32:00,198 --> 00:32:02,521
Is uh, possessed.

501
00:32:02,522 --> 00:32:05,849
- So it could have made it worse?
- Oh, yeah.

502
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:11,310
When they're not done
properly, all hell breaks loose.

503
00:32:15,173 --> 00:32:18,427
The other thing that I got was uh...

504
00:32:18,428 --> 00:32:23,542
About a living person at the
location, and this person is a female.

505
00:32:23,543 --> 00:32:27,179
I felt like she was the caretaker,
always taking care of everyone.

506
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,642
But nothing she does is working,

507
00:32:29,643 --> 00:32:33,893
and she feels like everything,
including her life, is falling apart.

508
00:32:33,894 --> 00:32:37,263
She hasn't been sleeping...
exhaustion, beat up.

509
00:32:37,264 --> 00:32:39,844
She's a mess.

510
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:46,080
And she has had thoughts of
possibly burning down the house.

511
00:32:46,374 --> 00:32:50,064
And feels very guilty because...

512
00:32:50,065 --> 00:32:52,848
She wants to leave...

513
00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:56,209
But she knows she can't.

514
00:33:03,889 --> 00:33:07,387
It's a constant struggle, daily.

515
00:33:07,388 --> 00:33:11,048
Trying to keep the kids safe.

516
00:33:11,443 --> 00:33:13,992
I haven't slept in years.

517
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:17,904
Watching your family get harmed by
something that you can't control...

518
00:33:17,905 --> 00:33:23,389
It makes you feel like you're not
a good parent, you're not anything.

519
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:28,231
And the house burning...
that's all I wish about.

520
00:33:28,232 --> 00:33:31,292
Every time I leave...

521
00:33:31,357 --> 00:33:33,833
I just pray that it burns down.

522
00:33:33,834 --> 00:33:38,762
Yeah, I'll lose everything,
but I'll gain my sanity.

523
00:33:38,763 --> 00:33:41,792
Never thought it was gonna
get this bad, you know?

524
00:33:41,793 --> 00:33:47,693
Somebody in this house is gonna
get either hurt or get killed.

525
00:33:52,821 --> 00:33:54,321
What else you see?

526
00:33:54,322 --> 00:33:57,270
So, there's one entity...

527
00:33:57,271 --> 00:34:01,428
That's actually interacting with the
family, and it's extremely powerful.

528
00:34:01,429 --> 00:34:07,329
And pretty much all of the
problems is generated by this thing.

529
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:12,200
And most people would
see it as a dark mass.

530
00:34:15,301 --> 00:34:20,101
It's something that
you would not mess with.

531
00:34:20,114 --> 00:34:23,714
Its main area is the garage.

532
00:34:24,485 --> 00:34:27,995
And I saw it aggressively
moving objects.

533
00:34:27,996 --> 00:34:30,028
It's very physical.

534
00:34:30,029 --> 00:34:32,400
Why don't you tell Amy
about what happens in there?

535
00:34:32,401 --> 00:34:38,044
I had a piece of concrete thrown
at me and hit me right in the back.

536
00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:42,185
And a one-inch wrench thrown at me.

537
00:34:42,871 --> 00:34:44,765
I want to show you something.

538
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:49,928
I had interviewed Zach, one of Kathy's
boys, and he showed me these pictures.

539
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:55,829
Now, I don't know if you can see
what's scratched into his chest.

540
00:34:56,484 --> 00:34:58,535
It spells "leave".

541
00:34:58,536 --> 00:34:59,781
Oh, yeah.

542
00:34:59,782 --> 00:35:02,790
And he swore to me he
didn't do it to himself.

543
00:35:02,791 --> 00:35:04,651
Wow.

544
00:35:05,651 --> 00:35:07,576
Could this thing do that?

545
00:35:07,577 --> 00:35:11,309
You know, I wouldn't discount
that as being a possibility.

546
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,098
Because it is an advanced entity,

547
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:19,979
so it can go into your mind
and it can project your fears.

548
00:35:20,976 --> 00:35:23,997
It knows what scares you.

549
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:29,349
When I first encountered it,
it was like a huge spider.

550
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:33,941
I saw this headless man
come into the room one night.

551
00:35:33,942 --> 00:35:36,894
And it told me to get out.

552
00:35:36,895 --> 00:35:39,235
Interesting.

553
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,845
Well, I had the sketch artist sketch,

554
00:35:43,846 --> 00:35:49,746
what I felt was the most
disturbing scene that I came across.

555
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,580
Take a look at that.

556
00:35:59,813 --> 00:36:02,453
Who's the kid?

557
00:36:03,436 --> 00:36:05,296
God.

558
00:36:08,823 --> 00:36:10,803
Mikey.

559
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:32,717
I had the sketch artist sketch the most
disturbing scene that I came across.

560
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:42,185
Take a look at that.

561
00:36:43,016 --> 00:36:45,656
Who's the kid?

562
00:36:45,899 --> 00:36:47,759
God.

563
00:36:49,467 --> 00:36:51,447
Mikey.

564
00:36:56,875 --> 00:36:59,214
- He's the youngest, by the way.
- Okay.

565
00:36:59,215 --> 00:37:02,447
- And he's, what, 5?
- 5.

566
00:37:02,448 --> 00:37:06,768
She's the one I called the babysitter.

567
00:37:06,817 --> 00:37:10,597
And you see who she really is.

568
00:37:12,258 --> 00:37:15,978
She has this child entranced...

569
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:22,154
And feeling safe, but
it's not a real girl.

570
00:37:22,155 --> 00:37:24,915
It's the entity.

571
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:29,852
He's constantly playing with somebody,

572
00:37:29,853 --> 00:37:32,277
and he'll wake up in the middle
of the night, he's laughing.

573
00:37:32,278 --> 00:37:34,440
I mean, hysterically laughing.

574
00:37:34,441 --> 00:37:39,120
I knew it was a small child
that was being manipulated.

575
00:37:39,121 --> 00:37:41,331
By this thing.

576
00:37:41,332 --> 00:37:46,972
If it's able to do these
things, what's the next step?

577
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,417
What is it?

578
00:37:53,418 --> 00:37:57,851
I mean, is it a human?
Is it not a human?

579
00:37:57,852 --> 00:37:59,584
It took me a while to figure out,

580
00:37:59,585 --> 00:38:04,513
but there was someone at some
point on that property who...

581
00:38:04,514 --> 00:38:07,514
Was into dark magic.

582
00:38:10,131 --> 00:38:12,931
And wanted revenge.

583
00:38:12,932 --> 00:38:18,572
This individual conjured up
this entity, this demon thing.

584
00:38:19,749 --> 00:38:23,209
- It's a Demon, then?
- Yeah.

585
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:27,290
That is what I would call a Demon.

586
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,421
It might have been kind of...

587
00:38:31,422 --> 00:38:34,080
Activated again by...

588
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:37,501
Some of the investigations.

589
00:38:38,304 --> 00:38:43,964
It's definitely attaching and
interacting with the family now.

590
00:38:43,965 --> 00:38:48,982
It sought out living people
to begin gaining more power.

591
00:38:48,983 --> 00:38:53,303
It's making people fight in the house.

592
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:57,201
And when I say fight, I mean fight.

593
00:38:57,202 --> 00:39:01,485
Like, I'm talking screaming,
physical fighting, yelling.

594
00:39:01,486 --> 00:39:06,819
And what it wants is for all of
you to turn against each other.

595
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:12,417
I call it kind of like a bloodbath,
because your blood boils. You just want...

596
00:39:12,418 --> 00:39:14,578
Oh, God.

597
00:39:14,816 --> 00:39:17,583
You want to hurt the person.

598
00:39:17,584 --> 00:39:20,829
And it's just over the stupidest things.

599
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:26,650
But once you go off the
property, you can feel the relief.

600
00:39:30,348 --> 00:39:34,324
Well, Kathy and Mike, this has been
a pretty tough night for you guys.

601
00:39:34,325 --> 00:39:37,460
But now at least you know what the
hell has been tormenting your family.

602
00:39:37,461 --> 00:39:40,624
The big question is, can you
stay in this house safely?

603
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:46,445
I can't answer that, so I'm
gonna turn that over to Amy.

604
00:39:49,741 --> 00:39:53,149
I believe the best
thing you could do for,

605
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:57,830
yourselves and your
children is to relocate.

606
00:40:00,219 --> 00:40:04,010
It's not too often that
this is the advice Amy gives,

607
00:40:04,011 --> 00:40:08,393
but for her to give it, it must
mean you got a serious problem.

608
00:40:08,394 --> 00:40:10,854
I'm leaving.

609
00:40:13,012 --> 00:40:16,647
Gonna just turn my back on the
property and go away. I'm sorry.

610
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:19,604
You know, I got to protect my family.

611
00:40:19,605 --> 00:40:24,816
Um... if they do decide to stay and
can't afford to move, what can they do?

612
00:40:24,817 --> 00:40:29,647
It's a lot of things that would
need to be done simultaneously.

613
00:40:29,648 --> 00:40:33,728
There is definitely PTSD here, okay?

614
00:40:34,389 --> 00:40:38,499
And that's something that needs
to be addressed through counseling.

615
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:42,602
So you need to go and see
someone who is a psychologist,

616
00:40:42,603 --> 00:40:46,631
or a psychiatrist who is
specially trained in PTSD.

617
00:40:46,632 --> 00:40:49,076
The other thing that's going
on while that's happening,

618
00:40:49,077 --> 00:40:54,678
is that a Catholic priest must
do an exorcism of the property.

619
00:40:54,679 --> 00:41:00,578
And must counsel the dead man, and then
remove him from the location, as well.

620
00:41:00,579 --> 00:41:04,411
- Would that get rid of the demon?
- Yes.

621
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:08,350
Why is it easier for them to just move
than to try to save the house and do that?

622
00:41:08,351 --> 00:41:13,092
In this situation, you have a
family that is in dire straits.

623
00:41:13,093 --> 00:41:13,824
Mm hmm.

624
00:41:13,825 --> 00:41:18,396
You have individuals at the
location who are extremely open.

625
00:41:18,397 --> 00:41:21,457
This is an emergency.

626
00:41:21,647 --> 00:41:26,034
And I don't think that
you, at this time...

627
00:41:26,035 --> 00:41:30,713
Need to be burdened
with all of that, too.

628
00:41:30,714 --> 00:41:33,754
I'd feel much better
by getting out of there.

629
00:41:33,755 --> 00:41:36,553
I mean, I'm not gonna
ruin what we have...

630
00:41:36,554 --> 00:41:39,817
And our family for just a house.

631
00:41:39,818 --> 00:41:41,828
It's tough, but it's a relief.

632
00:41:41,829 --> 00:41:46,658
I know what steps I have to
take to see the happiness again.

633
00:41:46,659 --> 00:41:51,822
I've seen so much sadness and
hate and blackness for so long.

634
00:41:51,823 --> 00:41:55,603
I want to see the light again.

635
00:41:55,891 --> 00:41:58,088
I wish I had better
news for Kathy and Mike,

636
00:41:58,089 --> 00:42:00,447
but this demon has become so powerful...

637
00:42:00,448 --> 00:42:03,146
That the only way to ensure
their family remains safe,

638
00:42:03,147 --> 00:42:07,452
is to get as far away from
this property as possible.
