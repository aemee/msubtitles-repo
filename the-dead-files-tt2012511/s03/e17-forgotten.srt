00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:05,181 --> 00:00:06,482
It's freaking creepy.

3
00:00:06,483 --> 00:00:09,017
- Is it dangerous?
- Yes.

4
00:00:09,018 --> 00:00:11,620
It's a matter of life or death.

5
00:00:11,621 --> 00:00:13,665
In this life, you think
you're being punished?

6
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,367
That's what it feels like.

7
00:00:15,368 --> 00:00:17,302
I don't like this.

8
00:00:17,303 --> 00:00:20,005
This is what was on my leg.

9
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:22,508
It was over there, and then it ran.

10
00:00:22,509 --> 00:00:24,976
And just all of a sudden went clang!

11
00:00:24,977 --> 00:00:28,697
This is the guy with the axe.

12
00:00:29,512 --> 00:00:31,625
He's crazy.

13
00:00:31,626 --> 00:00:34,386
Like, sociopathic.

14
00:00:35,822 --> 00:00:38,151
They're being watched.

15
00:00:38,152 --> 00:00:41,252
My name is Amy Allan.

16
00:00:41,253 --> 00:00:43,454
This thing likes death.

17
00:00:43,455 --> 00:00:44,896
I see dead people.

18
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:46,560
This thing's, like, a monster.

19
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:48,596
I speak to dead people.

20
00:00:48,597 --> 00:00:50,130
And he's pissed off now.

21
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:51,799
And they speak to me.

22
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,521
His head was cracked.

23
00:00:53,522 --> 00:00:56,937
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

24
00:00:56,938 --> 00:00:58,539
This guy was murdered.

25
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,107
I rely on my partner.

26
00:01:00,108 --> 00:01:03,377
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

27
00:01:03,378 --> 00:01:05,880
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

28
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:09,249
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

29
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,684
You saw her?

30
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:11,919
It's my job to reveal them.

31
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,148
Why would you stay here?

32
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:15,270
But Steve and I never speak...

33
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:17,324
We never communicate
during an investigation.

34
00:01:17,325 --> 00:01:18,692
Until the very end.

35
00:01:18,693 --> 00:01:20,528
Stop it.

36
00:01:20,529 --> 00:01:22,496
We uncover if it's safe for you to stay...

37
00:01:22,497 --> 00:01:24,998
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

38
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:26,400
Or time to get out.

39
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:31,081
I told you there were ghosts in this house.

40
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:53,410
Amy and I conduct our
investigations separately.

41
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:58,198
I interview witnesses and research
the history of each location.

42
00:01:58,199 --> 00:02:01,335
While Amy communicates with the dead.

43
00:02:01,336 --> 00:02:07,236
At the end, we reveal our findings
to our clients and each other.

44
00:02:07,642 --> 00:02:12,145
I'm in Bloomington, Illinois, a
couple of hours outside of Chicago.

45
00:02:12,146 --> 00:02:16,445
I'm heading over to meet
with a mom named Diane.

46
00:02:16,446 --> 00:02:20,020
She told me on the phone that there's a lot
of weird things happening in her house.

47
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:23,176
But the worst thing, the thing
that's keeping her up at night,

48
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:27,361
is she thinks the spirits are targeting
her son, who has special needs.

49
00:02:27,362 --> 00:02:31,982
Let's see if Amy and I can help her out.

50
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:42,042
Before Amy arrives, I clear the
area of any leading information.

51
00:02:42,043 --> 00:02:44,735
You can tell a lot about
the occupants of a house

52
00:02:44,736 --> 00:02:48,936
from their photos and religious icons.

53
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:56,218
I have to hide these items so
Amy isn't influenced by them.

54
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,440
As I open to communicate with the dead,

55
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,408
I begin picking up on flashes
of death in the area,

56
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:18,569
and one entity in particular
appears to be very dangerous.

57
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,170
I saw this man with an axe.

58
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:26,805
He smiles at me, and I feel sick.

59
00:03:35,176 --> 00:03:39,299
I said, hey, I'm here, you know,
if anybody wants to talk.

60
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,795
Or tell your story.

61
00:03:41,796 --> 00:03:47,696
And they said, no, you're not.
You're here to get rid of us.

62
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,146
And it sounded like a
young male and a girl.

63
00:03:53,147 --> 00:03:56,054
They think that I'm lying, that I'm
not here just to tell their story.

64
00:03:56,055 --> 00:04:01,875
I'm here to, like, get rid of
them, and that's not good.

65
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,233
Okay, Diane, so, what's going on?

66
00:04:18,234 --> 00:04:22,654
Ever since we built the house
about eight years ago.

67
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,297
We've heard footsteps.

68
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,411
We've seen apparitions.

69
00:04:27,412 --> 00:04:31,355
And it has began physically touching us.

70
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:35,534
And that has me really concerned
because my son, Zach.

71
00:04:35,535 --> 00:04:37,825
Has muscular dystrophy.

72
00:04:37,826 --> 00:04:40,728
- Oh, geez. How old is he?
- He's 15.

73
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:44,832
And it's left him using
a wheelchair full time.

74
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,768
Okay, why are you calling us
in now, what's the story?

75
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:53,641
It's gotten to the point where he's having
issues that doctors cannot explain,

76
00:04:53,642 --> 00:04:55,175
and also my health.

77
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:56,894
Okay, in what way?

78
00:04:56,895 --> 00:05:00,480
Unfortunately, I've had
to have surgery twice,

79
00:05:00,481 --> 00:05:04,718
to deal with the pain that
I've been experiencing.

80
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:07,888
Do you think it's something in the house
that may be causing the problems?

81
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:09,289
I think it is.

82
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,425
Can you show me some places in the house
where you've been experiencing things?

83
00:05:12,426 --> 00:05:14,286
Yes.

84
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,439
I was getting ready to make
dinner, and I looked up.

85
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,440
I saw an apparition.

86
00:05:29,976 --> 00:05:31,644
Okay, describe it to me.

87
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:37,405
He appeared to be, like, a rancher
with a hat, work boots, cowboy boots.

88
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:39,102
From what time period? You have any idea?

89
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:41,822
I would guess the late 1800s.

90
00:05:41,823 --> 00:05:46,395
And one time, I was actually
pushed in this room.

91
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:47,423
Pushed?

92
00:05:47,424 --> 00:05:51,864
Definitely felt a hand, and I was moved.

93
00:05:55,236 --> 00:05:58,296
I'm seeing this guy.

94
00:05:58,673 --> 00:06:02,933
The man from my opening with the axe.

95
00:06:04,846 --> 00:06:07,320
The man with the axe has
followed me into the house

96
00:06:07,321 --> 00:06:10,550
and is staring me down,
trying to intimidate me.

97
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:14,189
I think he enjoys
tormenting the living here.

98
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,537
Can you describe him?

99
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:19,214
He's wearing a white...

100
00:06:19,215 --> 00:06:23,061
Long-sleeved shirt with two
buttons and suspenders.

101
00:06:23,062 --> 00:06:24,865
He's pretty solid.

102
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:30,686
And usually, the solid ones are
more capable of interacting.

103
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,810
He's crazy.

104
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:39,002
Like, sociopathic.

105
00:06:43,718 --> 00:06:49,156
Ever since we moved in, anytime I've
been down here doing the laundry,

106
00:06:49,157 --> 00:06:52,952
I kind of catch something
on the corner of my eye.

107
00:06:52,953 --> 00:06:57,117
It looks like a dark figure, kind of short.

108
00:06:57,118 --> 00:07:00,324
Looks kind of like it
has maybe a hunchback.

109
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:03,745
Just goes by real quickly.

110
00:07:04,271 --> 00:07:08,531
I saw it today when I was down here.

111
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:14,490
- It made me feel really sick.
- You okay? Yeah?

112
00:07:14,491 --> 00:07:16,411
Yeah.

113
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:21,554
If Amy tells you it's not safe for you
to be here, what are you gonna do?

114
00:07:21,555 --> 00:07:24,345
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

115
00:07:24,346 --> 00:07:28,025
My son, he needs a lot
more care in this house.

116
00:07:28,026 --> 00:07:31,865
We have done everything to try
to make it adaptable for him,

117
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:37,766
so it wouldn't be easy for us, you
know, just to simply pack up and move.

118
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:43,850
It's a matter of life or death,
and I don't like to give up.

119
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:57,538
So, I see this doll thing.

120
00:08:03,544 --> 00:08:07,684
It was over there, and then it ran.

121
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:12,881
It, like...

122
00:08:12,882 --> 00:08:14,792
Went in here.

123
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:19,773
And it's all black...
like, solid, solid black.

124
00:08:21,182 --> 00:08:26,119
The man with the axe and the
little doll thing are related,

125
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,300
but I don't know how.

126
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:33,002
I don't think it wants me to...

127
00:08:33,003 --> 00:08:35,763
Know what it is.

128
00:08:37,531 --> 00:08:42,135
Or where it came from or why
it's here or what it's doing.

129
00:08:42,136 --> 00:08:46,023
So it does have some kind
of consciousness to it.

130
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:49,264
Is it dangerous at all?

131
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:51,187
Yes.

132
00:08:58,452 --> 00:09:00,854
Okay, what's going on in here?

133
00:09:00,855 --> 00:09:04,724
I was actually scratched across my leg.

134
00:09:04,725 --> 00:09:06,994
Do you have animals in the house?

135
00:09:06,995 --> 00:09:12,895
We have a couple of cats, but these scratch
marks are larger than a cat's claw.

136
00:09:14,781 --> 00:09:18,381
This is what was on my leg.

137
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:21,900
That's too big to be a cat.

138
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:24,559
Okay, anything else going
on in the bedroom?

139
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,500
Another time, I was lying in bed,

140
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:31,818
and I heard footsteps
coming across the floor.

141
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:34,888
And I felt a finger poke me.

142
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:37,057
Were you laying in bed with
your husband or just you?

143
00:09:37,058 --> 00:09:39,368
No, it was just me.

144
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:41,245
Is that all that's going
on, or you got more?

145
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:42,815
No.

146
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:46,956
I heard someone whisper in my ear...

147
00:09:47,201 --> 00:09:52,301
I had a little bit less
than two years to live.

148
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:54,408
- Male or a female?
- Female.

149
00:09:54,409 --> 00:10:00,309
- How long ago was that?
- A little bit less than two years ago.

150
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:07,562
Like, I'm hearing a child's laughter.

151
00:10:08,838 --> 00:10:14,127
I don't like it, you know?
It makes me uncomfortable.

152
00:10:14,128 --> 00:10:16,948
So, it's, like...

153
00:10:16,975 --> 00:10:19,230
This girl...

154
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:23,731
She's developed a twisted sense of humor.

155
00:10:24,973 --> 00:10:27,363
And what she does is,

156
00:10:27,364 --> 00:10:31,012
like, crawling under the bed and
doing bad things under the bed,

157
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:34,253
like coming up and out.

158
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:43,158
It's freaking creepy.

159
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:58,507
I feel like someone is
having issues with the bed.

160
00:10:58,508 --> 00:11:01,328
This girl child...

161
00:11:01,448 --> 00:11:06,406
Is, like, crawling under the bed and
doing bad things under the bed,

162
00:11:06,407 --> 00:11:09,647
like coming up and out.

163
00:11:11,456 --> 00:11:13,557
It's freaking creepy.

164
00:11:13,558 --> 00:11:17,191
I don't like this. She's
wearing a little...

165
00:11:17,192 --> 00:11:21,065
Like, a little dress that
poufs out like that.

166
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:23,046
And...

167
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,329
I don't know if they see her like that.

168
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,271
I see, like, more of like a mist.

169
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:31,152
Very, yeah, creepy.

170
00:11:43,944 --> 00:11:47,186
So, Zach, I was talking with mom, and she
was telling me about some of the things

171
00:11:47,187 --> 00:11:49,587
that are going on in his house
since you guys moved in.

172
00:11:49,588 --> 00:11:51,072
Mm-hmm.

173
00:11:51,073 --> 00:11:53,342
So, what about yourself?
What are you experiencing?

174
00:11:53,343 --> 00:11:56,264
One night, I was laying in bed,

175
00:11:56,265 --> 00:12:00,357
and I saw these kids playing on the floor.

176
00:12:00,358 --> 00:12:03,404
- How old would you say they were?
- About 7.

177
00:12:03,405 --> 00:12:06,674
And then they looked up,
and they just vanished.

178
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:09,130
Okay. What else are you experiencing?

179
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:14,119
Uh well, one night, I heard someone
rummaging through the drawers,

180
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,918
out in the kitchen.

181
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:20,822
And I was scared, so I just sat in my bed.

182
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,378
I was so scared. I thought
someone was in the house.

183
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:27,580
- Nobody was in the kitchen?
- No.

184
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:31,306
- Are you having trouble sleeping?
- Yeah.

185
00:12:31,307 --> 00:12:36,156
Normally, it takes like three
hours for me to go to sleep.

186
00:12:36,157 --> 00:12:39,248
- Are you hearing anything?
- Yeah, whispers.

187
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:41,661
Like a female whisper.

188
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:45,190
- And what is she saying?
- It's kind of mumbling.

189
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:49,511
Something like this, like, really quiet.

190
00:12:55,835 --> 00:12:59,075
This girl, she's young.

191
00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:05,972
Do you have any idea what...
what she's doing?

192
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:08,689
She's messing with the people.

193
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,550
So, it's like, you'd be in the
bed, and you would feel like

194
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:16,337
there was something crawling
around under your bed.

195
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:20,599
Then she likes to come up
out from under the bed.

196
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,380
And go up the side and on it.

197
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:27,306
This is creepy.

198
00:13:30,697 --> 00:13:34,139
Now, as far as the room goes,
what else are you experiencing?

199
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,796
Some soldiers here.

200
00:13:36,797 --> 00:13:38,838
And where were they, just
standing in the room here?

201
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:41,314
Yeah, they were standing and looking at me.

202
00:13:41,315 --> 00:13:46,115
And then they... one of
them started talking.

203
00:13:46,146 --> 00:13:48,496
He said, we'll be back.

204
00:13:48,497 --> 00:13:51,230
Like they were gonna come back to
see you again, what'd that mean?

205
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:55,621
Like, not scare me but
come back after I die.

206
00:13:55,622 --> 00:13:59,036
Now, what do you think is causing all
these visions of you seeing these guys?

207
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:01,168
I think I was previously...

208
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:02,874
Uh, a soldier.

209
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:08,775
Like, I was reincarnated as this
person for doing something bad.

210
00:14:09,469 --> 00:14:12,047
Now that you're in this life, you
think you're being punished?

211
00:14:12,048 --> 00:14:15,948
Yeah. That's what it feels like.

212
00:14:24,918 --> 00:14:27,655
You know Mark, talking to
Diane, she was saying that uh,

213
00:14:27,656 --> 00:14:31,331
she thinks that whatever's going on in the
house is affecting her and Zach physically.

214
00:14:31,332 --> 00:14:33,164
Um, how do you feel about all that?

215
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:38,203
I've seen them in pain and
upset, and it's frustrating.

216
00:14:38,204 --> 00:14:40,450
Are you experiencing anything here?

217
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:44,281
Just recently, I placed
those tubs over there.

218
00:14:44,282 --> 00:14:47,868
Like that blue one right there,
bent down to put it down,

219
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:51,850
and that clear plastic container
falls off the shelf...

220
00:14:51,851 --> 00:14:55,512
And just all of a sudden went clang!
Lands right in front of my head.

221
00:14:55,513 --> 00:14:57,395
Was it top-heavy, anything
in it that made it...

222
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,957
It was empty just like it is now.

223
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,341
- Was the cat down here maybe?
- No.

224
00:15:01,342 --> 00:15:03,395
I have no idea how that could've happened.

225
00:15:03,396 --> 00:15:07,476
That's kind of like a violent act.

226
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:15,206
I'm seeing that guy again.

227
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:18,927
This is the guy with the axe.

228
00:15:21,931 --> 00:15:24,783
He looks at me, and he smiles.

229
00:15:24,784 --> 00:15:27,908
And I didn't get a good feeling from him.

230
00:15:27,909 --> 00:15:30,988
I think that he got murdered.

231
00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:33,674
And so he's angry.

232
00:15:33,675 --> 00:15:38,226
Not a good combination for some
dead person you want in your house.

233
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:40,264
He's crazy..

234
00:15:40,265 --> 00:15:43,325
He... was a murderer.

235
00:15:55,332 --> 00:15:57,363
Now that I've spoken to the witnesses,

236
00:15:57,364 --> 00:15:59,552
I need to find out what
was on Diane's property

237
00:15:59,553 --> 00:16:03,975
before the house was built
just eight 1/2 years ago.

238
00:16:03,976 --> 00:16:06,144
I'm heading over to meet
with a local historian,

239
00:16:06,145 --> 00:16:10,825
and I'm hoping he has some answers for me.

240
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,527
The house I'm investigating,
it's only eight 1/2 years old.

241
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:26,465
I was wondering if you could help me out
and tell me what was there before that.

242
00:16:26,466 --> 00:16:32,366
It was a farm, over 300 acres at
one time, owned by William King.

243
00:16:32,804 --> 00:16:38,686
Came from Pennsylvania with his first
wife and four children in 1836.

244
00:16:38,687 --> 00:16:43,482
And the Kings owned the farm
right up until the 1950s.

245
00:16:43,483 --> 00:16:46,651
What can you tell me about William
King himself, what kind of guy was he?

246
00:16:46,652 --> 00:16:50,689
He had built a house. He had
become a successful farmer.

247
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,998
So, he had accomplished a great deal

248
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:57,818
and probably thought he had much
more time to accomplish more.

249
00:16:57,819 --> 00:17:02,128
But he died on the farm
at the age of 41 years.

250
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:05,669
It was a very tragic thing.

251
00:17:09,302 --> 00:17:14,513
The man with the axe, like, I don't
even know where this guy came from.

252
00:17:14,514 --> 00:17:17,139
Do you have any idea why he's here?

253
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,400
I see him, like, working on the land.

254
00:17:22,255 --> 00:17:25,290
- Like, maybe he owned it.
- Okay.

255
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:30,429
The weird thing is, now he's wearing
a suit, pants... nice pants.

256
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,310
Like he's wealthy.

257
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:37,605
And he's probably like in his 40s.

258
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:43,207
So, he comes here with his wife and
four kids, how's life for them?

259
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:46,602
They had a great many challenges here.

260
00:17:46,603 --> 00:17:52,316
At the age of 29, his first wife,
Amelia, died in childbirth.

261
00:17:52,317 --> 00:17:55,634
And two of his boys died
when they were young.

262
00:17:55,635 --> 00:17:59,357
Okay, so we can assume at least two of the
kids and Amelia died on the property.

263
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:02,255
- Yes.
- Okay. Now, he remarries?

264
00:18:02,256 --> 00:18:06,612
He remarried, and they proceeded
to have many more children.

265
00:18:06,613 --> 00:18:08,457
Now, Bill, do you know
about any other deaths

266
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:11,258
associated with the King
family on the property itself?

267
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:12,877
Yes.

268
00:18:12,878 --> 00:18:15,233
William's son George,

269
00:18:15,234 --> 00:18:19,333
died under very strange
circumstances in the 1870s.

270
00:18:19,334 --> 00:18:21,200
Okay. How did he die?

271
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:24,358
The paper which describes
the incident in some length

272
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,259
doesn't really know why he died.

273
00:18:32,606 --> 00:18:35,133
Bill didn't know too much
about George's death,

274
00:18:35,134 --> 00:18:37,657
but I've tracked down a historian who does.

275
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:43,558
So, I'm heading over to his farm to find
out what made this death so mysterious.

276
00:18:51,777 --> 00:18:55,184
George was 24, almost 25 when he died.

277
00:18:55,185 --> 00:18:59,804
He was kind of a wild kid. Uh,
he'd been a partyer, a drinker.

278
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,307
Unlike his father, who was
a justice of the peace

279
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,241
and active in the community
and very well-respected.

280
00:19:05,242 --> 00:19:08,593
Now, did George ever run the
farm or take over at any point?

281
00:19:08,594 --> 00:19:12,764
No. The farm went to Zephaniah,
his younger brother.

282
00:19:12,765 --> 00:19:14,680
Not George.

283
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:18,608
This is the chain of deeds,
and George was never on it.

284
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:20,416
Which is not common.

285
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:23,475
No. Ordinarily, it would've
gone to the oldest

286
00:19:23,476 --> 00:19:25,944
son that was available to run the farm.

287
00:19:25,945 --> 00:19:30,505
But George was unreliable, and the family
depended on the farm for an income.

288
00:19:30,506 --> 00:19:33,561
And couldn't turn it over to
somebody they couldn't trust.

289
00:19:33,562 --> 00:19:35,482
Okay.

290
00:19:47,466 --> 00:19:50,101
There's these two men, and they're
yelling, they're yelling.

291
00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:53,404
They're fighting each other.
They're punching each other.

292
00:19:53,405 --> 00:19:57,005
And it's getting really bad.

293
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:02,728
This one guy really, really
wants to see the other one dead

294
00:20:02,729 --> 00:20:07,910
because he's preventing him
from having what he wants.

295
00:20:07,911 --> 00:20:11,130
I think it's a land thing.

296
00:20:11,131 --> 00:20:13,191
Can you describe either of them at all?

297
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:16,342
Well, one dude, he's
probably in his mid 20s,

298
00:20:16,343 --> 00:20:19,644
and he's got light brown eyes
and the blond hair and...

299
00:20:19,645 --> 00:20:23,365
Do you get any names on them?

300
00:20:23,593 --> 00:20:26,293
I get a George.

301
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:32,285
But people don't like him because,
you know, he's (Bleep) crazy.

302
00:20:32,286 --> 00:20:35,276
Now, I heard that George
died kind of mysteriously.

303
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:37,355
Do you know anything about that?

304
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:41,136
I found this article from 1875.

305
00:20:42,006 --> 00:20:45,303
Apparently, George was over
at the house for dinner.

306
00:20:45,304 --> 00:20:48,877
He took a nap on the couch, and they saw he
was still asleep when it was time to eat,

307
00:20:48,878 --> 00:20:50,836
so they went ahead and ate without him.

308
00:20:50,837 --> 00:20:56,734
After dinner, they were all
outside, and a gunshot was heard.

309
00:20:56,735 --> 00:20:58,899
So they rushed into the
house, and there was George,

310
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,344
laying there on the sofa
with a hole in his chest.

311
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:03,330
- Okay, was he dead already?
- No.

312
00:21:03,331 --> 00:21:05,606
They revived him enough that he could talk,

313
00:21:05,607 --> 00:21:08,210
and he hold them it was...
it was an accident.

314
00:21:08,211 --> 00:21:13,282
He was exchanging his gun from his
pants pocket to his vest pocket.

315
00:21:13,283 --> 00:21:15,918
And it went off at that point.

316
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,459
He died a short time later.

317
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:26,966
They're fighting each other, and
I see the blood in the dirt,

318
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:30,813
and there's dirt being
kicked up in a cloud.

319
00:21:30,814 --> 00:21:33,916
And everybody's like, oh, my God! Aah!

320
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,544
Oh, no! You know, and freaking out.

321
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,950
Do you know if either of
them were successful?

322
00:21:38,951 --> 00:21:43,468
I don't think that anybody
got killed in the fight.

323
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,728
But I see, like, the blond.

324
00:21:46,729 --> 00:21:50,599
He's, like, in this little house.

325
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,920
And there's a table, like, to eat at.

326
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:01,401
And I see him, like, in darkness.

327
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,620
And I hear the sound of a gun go off.

328
00:22:06,749 --> 00:22:08,669
Dead.

329
00:22:17,497 --> 00:22:19,777
With five deaths involving the King family,

330
00:22:19,778 --> 00:22:21,646
who lived on the property
I'm investigating,

331
00:22:21,647 --> 00:22:26,367
Diane's house might as
well sit in a graveyard.

332
00:22:26,368 --> 00:22:31,228
But I need to know if
there's anything else.

333
00:22:33,825 --> 00:22:35,164
Digging through the archives,

334
00:22:35,165 --> 00:22:41,065
I discovered that something called a poor
farm once operated right next to her home.

335
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:46,867
But the records don't explain
what the hell a poor farm is.

336
00:22:46,868 --> 00:22:49,369
So, I'm on my way to meet
with a local archivist,

337
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:55,270
who says it represents a very dark
chapter in Bloomington's history.

338
00:23:04,852 --> 00:23:09,436
A poor farm was an institution
run by the County,

339
00:23:09,437 --> 00:23:14,092
that would care for those who were
unable to care for themselves...

340
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:17,745
The mentally ill, the
physically disabled...

341
00:23:17,746 --> 00:23:20,266
The uh, poor.

342
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:26,233
Kind of those on the outside of society
where the social safety net had failed.

343
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,446
We happen to have at the McLean
County Museum of History

344
00:23:29,447 --> 00:23:35,347
several photographs of the poor farm, and
here's one of the complex of buildings.

345
00:23:35,924 --> 00:23:37,257
Wow.

346
00:23:37,258 --> 00:23:42,428
The poor farm in McLean County
was established in 1859, 1860.

347
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:45,666
What about deaths on the property?
Were there any reported deaths there?

348
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:47,835
We do have a death and burial record.

349
00:23:47,836 --> 00:23:52,707
The Superintendent said there
were at least 173 known burials.

350
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:58,608
And at least 300-plus others buried
on the site with no markers.

351
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,235
There's, like...

352
00:24:07,236 --> 00:24:10,116
All these people...

353
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:13,346
Like...

354
00:24:13,347 --> 00:24:16,947
Walking around back in there.

355
00:24:19,353 --> 00:24:22,893
Really poor, like, no money.

356
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:30,196
I do feel like there's a place that
this is all coming from or something.

357
00:24:30,197 --> 00:24:33,388
Any idea what kind of time
frame this might be in?

358
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:37,349
1880s to like 1910, I'm thinking.

359
00:24:41,308 --> 00:24:43,443
What were the conditions like?

360
00:24:43,444 --> 00:24:48,290
There was not really an attempt made to
rehabilitate or care for these people.

361
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:49,104
Okay.

362
00:24:49,105 --> 00:24:52,318
So, they provided room and
board and little else.

363
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:57,090
Local clergy would make appearances
on Sunday for church services.

364
00:24:57,091 --> 00:25:00,098
Local physicians would care for the people,

365
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:03,462
provide some basic needs for these folks.

366
00:25:03,463 --> 00:25:09,341
In 1877, the Daily Pantagraph, which is
the longtime newspaper for Bloomington...

367
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:12,913
A reporter went out there and
called the McLean County poor farm

368
00:25:12,914 --> 00:25:18,254
one of the saddest sights
that mortal eyes can view.

369
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,348
In 1915, an Inspector with
the state of Illinois

370
00:25:22,349 --> 00:25:25,303
made an appearance at the
McLean County poor farm.

371
00:25:25,304 --> 00:25:28,735
And said that the livestock,
the cattle and hogs.

372
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:34,636
Were better cared for and had
better housing than the inmates.

373
00:25:36,964 --> 00:25:40,167
Their clothes are all ripped up and stuff,

374
00:25:40,168 --> 00:25:43,103
and they don't have shoes, a lot of them.

375
00:25:43,104 --> 00:25:46,764
They're not carrying anything.

376
00:25:47,074 --> 00:25:51,578
I see, like, a big sign
that says, religion on it.

377
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:57,044
There's, like, all these people
that are, like, coming out.

378
00:25:57,045 --> 00:26:00,820
And they're all, like, kind
of scared of something.

379
00:26:00,821 --> 00:26:04,469
- Like, unhinged is the word.
- What makes you say that?

380
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,070
Because they're freaking out.

381
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,268
During my walk, there were too many dead
people outside to focus on specific faces.

382
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:20,510
So I'm concentrating on the dead girl,

383
00:26:20,511 --> 00:26:25,228
who wants to scare the living
by hiding under their beds.

384
00:26:25,229 --> 00:26:29,009
There's one person in the bed.

385
00:26:29,071 --> 00:26:32,552
Kind of in the middle of it.

386
00:26:32,553 --> 00:26:35,914
It's the person under a cover?

387
00:26:35,915 --> 00:26:39,194
This kind of sheet of...

388
00:26:39,195 --> 00:26:41,409
Like, gray mist.

389
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:45,631
Is coming out from under the
bed, going up alongside the bed.

390
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:50,072
And then going over the top of the bed.

391
00:26:52,606 --> 00:26:55,726
Is this what you saw?

392
00:26:57,261 --> 00:26:59,121
Yes.

393
00:27:21,404 --> 00:27:25,338
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations.

394
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:29,864
We're going to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

395
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:32,501
Mark, Diane, I want you
to meet my partner, Amy.

396
00:27:32,502 --> 00:27:35,270
They'd moved in here about
eight 1/2 years ago.

397
00:27:35,271 --> 00:27:39,019
They have a son, Zach, who
is confined to a wheelchair.

398
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,021
And from the minute they moved in,
they've been experiencing things.

399
00:27:42,022 --> 00:27:45,314
But recently, it's gotten
a lot more active.

400
00:27:45,315 --> 00:27:49,357
Diane's health and even Zach's
health has been going downhill.

401
00:27:49,358 --> 00:27:52,944
And it's making their life
really hard for them here.

402
00:27:52,945 --> 00:27:55,837
They need to know if it's
safe to stay here or not.

403
00:27:55,838 --> 00:28:01,738
With that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy
and see if she has some answers for you.

404
00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:10,418
Outside, there were all of these people.

405
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:13,947
They were kind of coming
unhinged about something.

406
00:28:13,948 --> 00:28:16,695
Um, they were extremely poor.

407
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:20,128
And I got that this was like 100 years ago.

408
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:24,499
It's interesting. Very close to where
we are was a thing called a poor farm.

409
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,395
And it ran from 1850 into the 1950s.

410
00:28:28,396 --> 00:28:33,710
And this poor farm housed the mentally
ill, the disabled, homeless...

411
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:37,791
Anybody that didn't fit in society.

412
00:28:37,886 --> 00:28:40,729
Here's what it looked like.

413
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:45,841
And this is literally less
than a mile from where we are.

414
00:28:45,842 --> 00:28:50,608
The odd thing is, if they died,
they buried them on the land.

415
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:55,703
I've got a list here of 173
people that are documented...

416
00:28:55,704 --> 00:28:58,944
Buried on this property.

417
00:29:01,048 --> 00:29:02,411
Wow.

418
00:29:02,412 --> 00:29:07,032
They estimate there's at least another 300.

419
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,835
Do you think the people that
we're talking about here,

420
00:29:11,836 --> 00:29:15,581
that they are the lost people out here?

421
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:19,662
There were people who were acting...

422
00:29:19,748 --> 00:29:21,851
Bizarrely.

423
00:29:21,852 --> 00:29:25,692
So, yes, I believe that's them.

424
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:34,799
So, what else did you see?

425
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,000
I encountered a male who had an axe.

426
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:42,527
And he had on suspenders.

427
00:29:42,534 --> 00:29:44,403
And a white shirt.

428
00:29:44,404 --> 00:29:47,686
But when I saw him in
here, he was in a suit.

429
00:29:47,687 --> 00:29:52,138
So, he seemed to be probably
a wealthier individual.

430
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:55,223
The bad thing about him is
that he's absolutely crazy.

431
00:29:55,224 --> 00:29:57,434
I would say he's a sociopath.

432
00:29:57,435 --> 00:30:00,036
He looks at me, and he smiles.

433
00:30:00,037 --> 00:30:01,705
I didn't get a good feeling from him.

434
00:30:01,706 --> 00:30:03,544
He's angry.

435
00:30:03,545 --> 00:30:09,445
Not a good combination for some
dead person you want in your house.

436
00:30:09,946 --> 00:30:15,031
He's a very solid dead person, so
he knows how to manipulate energy,

437
00:30:15,032 --> 00:30:18,278
and he's able to manipulate
his surroundings.

438
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:20,734
Why don't you tell her what
happened to you in the kitchen?

439
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:24,586
I felt a definite shove on my hip.

440
00:30:24,587 --> 00:30:27,970
Like a push, like pushed out of the way.

441
00:30:27,971 --> 00:30:31,391
I was absolutely terrified.

442
00:30:32,982 --> 00:30:34,774
Wow.

443
00:30:34,775 --> 00:30:36,376
So, you said this guy was wealthy?

444
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:38,064
Yes.

445
00:30:38,065 --> 00:30:42,566
Well, this house sits on what
was once a 350-acre farm.

446
00:30:42,567 --> 00:30:47,419
Owned by this guy William King,
who settled here in 1836.

447
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,528
But the thing is, he
became wealthy from the

448
00:30:49,529 --> 00:30:52,692
land because this is
really good farmland here.

449
00:30:52,693 --> 00:30:55,212
- Now, you mentioned he was angry.
- Yes.

450
00:30:55,213 --> 00:30:59,074
Well, his wife Amelia died
at a very young age...

451
00:30:59,075 --> 00:31:03,515
- Oh, really?
- Of 29, giving childbirth.

452
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,769
And he suffered some more tragedy.
He lost two sons.

453
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,931
They died on the property.

454
00:31:09,932 --> 00:31:11,773
Does that make any sense to you?

455
00:31:11,774 --> 00:31:14,128
I did get two children in the house.

456
00:31:14,129 --> 00:31:16,874
One is a girl, and one's a boy.

457
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,279
And they were not excited to see me because

458
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,375
they knew that when I walked in the door,

459
00:31:22,376 --> 00:31:25,760
they were like, oh, you're
gonna get rid of us.

460
00:31:25,761 --> 00:31:28,704
I have sensed for years...

461
00:31:28,705 --> 00:31:31,818
That there is a child.

462
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:34,579
Um, I could hear the little...

463
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,038
- Footsteps.
- Mm-hmm.

464
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:41,302
Come by me, next to me when I
was getting ready to go to bed.

465
00:31:41,303 --> 00:31:43,743
And Zach said kids were
playing with his trucks.

466
00:31:43,744 --> 00:31:45,973
He woke up. When he was real little.

467
00:31:45,974 --> 00:31:47,900
- Yeah.
- Two kids playing.

468
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:51,049
He'd hear the wheels
squeaking on his truck.

469
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:53,985
Yeah, the girl here is very active.

470
00:31:53,986 --> 00:31:57,944
She likes to hide under the beds.
This is her form of entertainment.

471
00:31:57,945 --> 00:32:03,765
She'll, like, want to crawl
up and get into bed with you.

472
00:32:04,379 --> 00:32:06,488
She's very touchy-feely.

473
00:32:06,489 --> 00:32:12,389
I do feel like there's something in our
bedroom when we're trying to sleep.

474
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:15,050
Now, you mentioned touchy-feely.

475
00:32:15,051 --> 00:32:17,151
- Yes.
- She's been poked.

476
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:21,193
It actually felt like it was something
that a kid would do to you.

477
00:32:21,194 --> 00:32:25,154
I felt a distinct tap on my leg.

478
00:32:25,723 --> 00:32:28,625
She's also had another
incident in the bedroom,

479
00:32:28,626 --> 00:32:33,006
which I want to show you a picture of.

480
00:32:33,631 --> 00:32:35,491
Wow.

481
00:32:35,566 --> 00:32:39,586
I felt... just a strange sensation.

482
00:32:39,796 --> 00:32:43,594
And I saw that, I about lost
my mind when I saw that.

483
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:48,277
It frightens me because I was like, is
that evil, where did that come from?

484
00:32:48,278 --> 00:32:51,648
Let me ask you a question about getting
poked, do ya think that's this little girl?

485
00:32:51,649 --> 00:32:54,770
The poking, yeah. Definitely.

486
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:57,656
But what about this?

487
00:32:57,657 --> 00:33:01,497
That actually could be your son.

488
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:07,911
There's something called
spontaneous psychokinesis.

489
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:13,560
Some people have a little bit
more energy than others.

490
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:18,290
And occasionally, people can
influence their environment...

491
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:19,819
Spontaneously.

492
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,364
And it doesn't mean that
they're attacking anybody.

493
00:33:22,365 --> 00:33:26,037
It doesn't mean they're doing it on
purpose, it just means it's like...

494
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:30,642
It's almost like a burst of
energy that just pops, okay?

495
00:33:30,643 --> 00:33:36,543
And so with any ability, you're going
to have experiences like this.

496
00:33:36,716 --> 00:33:38,717
And how old is your son?

497
00:33:38,718 --> 00:33:40,518
15.

498
00:33:40,887 --> 00:33:43,465
It can be hormonal.

499
00:33:43,466 --> 00:33:48,043
Usually, it's around children
who are, you know...

500
00:33:48,044 --> 00:33:50,264
Teenagers.

501
00:33:50,353 --> 00:33:54,193
Does Diane's son have abilities?

502
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,351
Probably, yeah.

503
00:33:58,352 --> 00:34:01,232
Because Diane does.

504
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:04,646
It's kind of strange, the
same night the scratches,

505
00:34:04,647 --> 00:34:06,644
we had to take Zach in the emergency room.

506
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:08,717
He appeared to, like, have a seizure.

507
00:34:08,718 --> 00:34:12,022
If he's having seizures or something,
you know, around or following that,

508
00:34:12,023 --> 00:34:15,803
that could be a trigger signal.

509
00:34:17,019 --> 00:34:18,527
I've encountered this before.

510
00:34:18,528 --> 00:34:21,318
People who don't know they have
abilities can't control them,

511
00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:24,955
and sometimes their bodies can
react in unexplained ways.

512
00:34:24,956 --> 00:34:28,921
So, I did do a sketch of what I saw

513
00:34:28,922 --> 00:34:32,262
in The Master Bedroom with the girl.

514
00:34:32,263 --> 00:34:37,603
Okay. I don't get to see
Amy's sketches until now.

515
00:35:06,256 --> 00:35:09,807
I did do a sketch of what I saw,

516
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:13,948
in The Master Bedroom with the girl.

517
00:35:26,772 --> 00:35:29,941
I see her, and she's crawling
around under the bed,

518
00:35:29,942 --> 00:35:35,842
but some people might see the mist
that's kind of emitted by her.

519
00:35:36,281 --> 00:35:39,941
That's usually where I sleep.

520
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,170
What does she want?

521
00:35:43,171 --> 00:35:47,034
She's very bored and, like,
having fun, trying to have fun,

522
00:35:47,035 --> 00:35:50,995
and that's her fun, unfortunately.

523
00:35:51,904 --> 00:35:54,429
One night, I was trying to sleep.

524
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:58,538
I heard a distinct whisper
right up against my ear.

525
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:01,398
It was a female that said...

526
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:06,235
"You have a little bit less
than two years to live".

527
00:36:06,236 --> 00:36:11,489
It was almost two years ago.
Now we're at that time.

528
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:14,250
Am I the target?

529
00:36:14,499 --> 00:36:18,459
I think everyone in the house is.

530
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:30,781
So, did you encounter anything else?

531
00:36:31,301 --> 00:36:37,201
Down here in the basement, I
actually witnessed a huge fistfight.

532
00:36:37,407 --> 00:36:39,629
There was a male named George.

533
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,634
He was in his 20s.

534
00:36:41,635 --> 00:36:44,487
Apparently, he had inherited land,

535
00:36:44,488 --> 00:36:47,272
and him and this other dead
guy were in a fistfight.

536
00:36:47,273 --> 00:36:51,409
Because the other guy wanted
to take this land from...

537
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:54,170
This kid, George.

538
00:36:54,453 --> 00:36:58,999
And then I see the young guy
George in a small house.

539
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,155
And then I heard a gunshot.

540
00:37:01,156 --> 00:37:04,128
And I think George...

541
00:37:04,129 --> 00:37:06,469
Was killed.

542
00:37:07,895 --> 00:37:10,375
I got to tell you something
this is the most amazing,

543
00:37:10,376 --> 00:37:13,399
thing I've heard as far
as, like, nailing it.

544
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,569
William King, who settled
here, had a son named George.

545
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,159
Oh.

546
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,805
Now, William died pretty young.

547
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:26,706
And George was the oldest available son
that should've been taking over the farm.

548
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,807
But he didn't get it.

549
00:37:28,808 --> 00:37:31,205
It went, actually, to his younger brother.

550
00:37:31,206 --> 00:37:34,846
I can only assume that
he had to feel slighted.

551
00:37:34,847 --> 00:37:39,455
And been pissed off that
he didn't get property.

552
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:42,851
But he was a drunk in town,
always partying and,

553
00:37:42,852 --> 00:37:46,338
because he was such an irresponsible
24-year-old for the time,

554
00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:48,416
they didn't want to give it to him.

555
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:51,965
Now, George came here to
the farm, to the house.

556
00:37:51,966 --> 00:37:54,133
He went inside to lie down.

557
00:37:54,134 --> 00:37:56,637
He took his pistol that he carried...

558
00:37:56,638 --> 00:38:01,609
A four-shot pistol... took it from his
pocket, and transferred it into his vest.

559
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:05,450
And he accidentally shot himself.

560
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:18,043
The next thing that I ran into
was this weird, little, like...

561
00:38:18,044 --> 00:38:21,584
I kept calling it the doll.

562
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:26,073
It's all dark. It's,
like, made of darkness.

563
00:38:26,074 --> 00:38:30,678
It's somehow attached to
the guy with the axe.

564
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:34,085
It's a part of him. It's
very, very negative.

565
00:38:34,086 --> 00:38:39,240
I was trying to connect with
it, and I saw it, and then...

566
00:38:39,241 --> 00:38:43,141
It ran into the wall over there.

567
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,506
That is amazing.

568
00:38:47,507 --> 00:38:49,427
What?

569
00:38:49,657 --> 00:38:54,060
I kept seeing something out of the
corner of my eye from the laundry area.

570
00:38:54,061 --> 00:38:59,461
It shoots straight out of,
like, the wall over there.

571
00:39:01,736 --> 00:39:04,721
It was a solid, black
mass, but it was small.

572
00:39:04,722 --> 00:39:07,938
- It was like 3 feet tall maybe.
- Yeah.

573
00:39:07,939 --> 00:39:13,264
It's this little thing that the axe
man created that can do his bidding.

574
00:39:13,265 --> 00:39:17,243
If he wants to do something,
he would work through it.

575
00:39:17,244 --> 00:39:21,131
So, it's here all the time, but he's not.
See, he comes and goes.

576
00:39:21,132 --> 00:39:25,771
His thing is to make people nuts
like him, because he's crazy.

577
00:39:25,772 --> 00:39:31,033
And so he would want to, like,
torture and drive you nuts.

578
00:39:31,034 --> 00:39:32,613
And that's no way to live.

579
00:39:32,614 --> 00:39:36,286
No, we don't need some creepy guy or...

580
00:39:36,287 --> 00:39:39,197
Weird thing in the basement.

581
00:39:39,198 --> 00:39:41,852
I'd like to be able to be
free of these things so

582
00:39:41,853 --> 00:39:45,568
that I can focus on being
as good a mother as I can.

583
00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:48,740
It doesn't help that this is going on.

584
00:39:48,741 --> 00:39:51,561
- Yeah.
- Mm hmm.

585
00:39:52,911 --> 00:39:56,699
We want to be a normal
family as much as possible

586
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:02,123
because we're under unusual circumstances
anyway with having a high-needs child.

587
00:40:02,124 --> 00:40:05,252
And I worry about him because
he's confined to that chair.

588
00:40:05,253 --> 00:40:09,393
- Mm mm.
- And completely vulnerable.

589
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:18,217
Obviously, you've got a lot of
serious things going on here.

590
00:40:18,218 --> 00:40:22,694
But the pressing question is,
is it safe for you to be here?

591
00:40:22,695 --> 00:40:28,595
With that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy
and see if she has some answers for you.

592
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,794
You have a lot of dead
around this location,

593
00:40:32,795 --> 00:40:36,817
but the one who's really a problem
at this point is the little girl,

594
00:40:36,818 --> 00:40:39,573
because she's, like, a
fully conscious entity.

595
00:40:39,574 --> 00:40:42,831
You need to have a medium come in,

596
00:40:42,832 --> 00:40:46,334
and she's gonna have to get
this little girl out of here.

597
00:40:46,335 --> 00:40:51,206
When the medium comes through, she'll
also do a cleansing around the property.

598
00:40:51,207 --> 00:40:54,327
To set up a boundary.

599
00:40:54,582 --> 00:40:58,242
Against the man with the axe.

600
00:40:58,348 --> 00:41:03,019
And other various dead who
might wander through.

601
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:06,996
The little thing down here, which
is attached to the axe man,

602
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:11,129
keeping him out is going to
cause that link to dissipate.

603
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:14,340
And so it'll probably
make him just go... ffft!

604
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:16,501
No more.

605
00:41:16,646 --> 00:41:18,441
So, once they're able to,

606
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:21,192
establish where there's no more
dead around here or in the house,

607
00:41:21,193 --> 00:41:23,559
will she start to feel better?

608
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,720
Oh, yes.

609
00:41:26,062 --> 00:41:28,818
My question to you now is, are
you gonna follow Amy's advice?

610
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,266
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes.

611
00:41:30,267 --> 00:41:35,667
I don't have to live in
complete fear all the time.

612
00:41:35,939 --> 00:41:38,922
I understand why Diane fears
for her son's well-being.

613
00:41:38,923 --> 00:41:41,792
Encountering that many
entities can be terrifying,

614
00:41:41,793 --> 00:41:44,260
but I'm confident that if
she follows my advice,

615
00:41:44,261 --> 00:41:47,976
she and her family should lead
a happy and peaceful life.
