1
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:08,839
- <i> TONIGHT...</i>
- BANG!

2
00:00:08,874 --> 00:00:12,543
<i>...ON "DEAD FILES REVISITED"...</i>
- TERRY TOOK OVER MY BODY.

3
00:00:12,578 --> 00:00:14,680
<i> A SECOND LOOK
AT SOME OF AMY AND STEVE'S</i>

4
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:17,316
<i> MOST TERRIFYING CASES.</i>

5
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,835
<i> NEW INFORMATION.</i>

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,284
EVERYTHING WAS TRUE.

7
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:22,753
<i> STARTLING REVELATIONS.</i>

8
00:00:22,788 --> 00:00:24,857
THERE'S THINGS OUT THERE
THAT DEFY EXPLANATION.

9
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:27,458
<i> FIRST-- </i>

10
00:00:27,493 --> 00:00:29,794
<i> A RETURN
TO VIRGINIA CITY, NEVADA,</i>

11
00:00:29,795 --> 00:00:33,464
<i> WHERE A FRIGHTENING ENTITY...</i>
- CREEPY.

12
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:36,434
- <i> THREATENED A WOMAN'S LIFE...</i>
- I AM SCARED TO DEATH.

13
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:39,188
<i> AND LED AMY TO PRESCRIBE
A DRASTIC CURE.</i>

14
00:00:39,223 --> 00:00:41,908
I NEVER EVEN HEARD
YOU SAY THAT WORD BEFORE.

15
00:00:41,943 --> 00:00:44,142
<i> THEN...</i>

16
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:46,077
THERE ARE GHOSTS IN THIS HOUSE.

17
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:49,048
<i> WE TRAVEL BACK
TO BLACKSHEAR, GEORGIA,</i>

18
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,084
<i> WHERE UNSPEAKABLE TERROR</i>

19
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,320
<i> INVADED A FAMILY'S HOME...</i>

20
00:00:53,355 --> 00:00:55,521
MY DAUGHTER SEES
A GHOST GIRL.

21
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,288
<i> AND THE REVEAL...</i>

22
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:59,323
- <i> THAT DROVE AMY TO THE EDGE.</i>
- I'M SORRY.

23
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:01,258
THERE WAS A GIRL
THAT DIED HERE.

24
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:03,494
<i> DID THEY FOLLOW
AMY'S ADVICE?</i>

25
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:06,099
I TOLD YOU THERE WERE
GHOSTS IN THIS HOUSE.

26
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,402
THERE'S SOMETHING DOWN THERE.

27
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:14,272
MY NAME IS AMY ALLAN.

28
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:16,609
A LOT OF DEAD PEOPLE ARE HERE.

29
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:17,960
I SEE DEAD PEOPLE.

30
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,277
THIS IS NOT GOOD.

31
00:01:19,278 --> 00:01:21,346
I SPEAK TO DEAD PEOPLE...

32
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,649
HE IS VERY PISSED OFF.

33
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:24,801
AND THEY SPEAK TO ME...

34
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:25,883
THE HOUSE IS ANGRY.

35
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:29,155
BUT THERE'S ONLY WAY TO KNOW
IF MY FINDINGS ARE REAL.

36
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,007
HE'S KILLED PEOPLE.

37
00:01:31,042 --> 00:01:32,718
I RELY ON MY PARTNER.

38
00:01:32,753 --> 00:01:34,359
I'M STEVE Di SCHIAVI.

39
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,161
I'M A RETIRED NEW YORK CITY
HOMICIDE DETECTIVE...

40
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,695
HE GOT SHOT AT HIS HOUSE?

41
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,733
AND I KNOW EVERY PERSON,
EVERY<i> HOUSE</i> HAS SECRETS.

42
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:43,334
- AREN'T YOU TERRIFIED BEING HERE?
- IT'S MY JOB TO REVEAL 'EM.

43
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:45,571
THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING
OUT OF "THE EXORCIST."

44
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,772
BUT STEVE AND I NEVER
SPEAK...

45
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:51,045
- WE NEVER COMMUNICATE DURING
AN INVESTIGATION. - UNTIL THE VERY END.

46
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,110
IT'S BAD.

47
00:01:53,145 --> 00:01:55,881
AND WE UNCOVER IF IT'S SAFE
FOR YOU TO STAY...

48
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,115
I'D LIKE SOME ANSWERS.

49
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,315
OR TIME TO GET OUT.

50
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,264
VIRGINIA CITY, NEVADA,

51
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,265
JUST A HALF-HOUR OUTSIDE OF RENO

52
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,054
WAS LIKE STEPPING BACK
INTO THE WILD WEST.

53
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:21,773
AMY AND I WERE CALLED IN
BY A WOMAN, DEBBIE,

54
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,010
WHO WORKED AT A MUSEUM
CALLED THE MACKAY MANSION.

55
00:02:24,045 --> 00:02:26,043
SHE WAS AFRAID

56
00:02:26,078 --> 00:02:29,046
...
...
...
757
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,031
BUT MY HUSBAND WAS NOT.

758
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,965
I KNEW ROBERT WOULDN'T DO IT.

759
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,969
HE JUST DIDN'T THINK
HE WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE.

760
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:15,003
I HAD CONCERNS

761
00:41:15,038 --> 00:41:17,372
ABOUT GOING
TO A CATHOLIC PRIEST

762
00:41:17,407 --> 00:41:19,408
AND HAVING HIM LOOK AT ME
LIKE I WAS CRAZY.

763
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:24,081
BUT OVER TIME, THE ACTIVITY
WE'VE HAD HERE IN THE HOUSE

764
00:41:24,116 --> 00:41:26,217
HAS BECOME PROGRESSIVELY WORSE.

765
00:41:29,419 --> 00:41:33,123
WE FINALLY DID
WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO.

766
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:35,156
WE HAD A PRIEST COME IN,

767
00:41:35,191 --> 00:41:37,961
AND HE DID THE STEPS
THAT AMY HAD TALKED ABOUT.

768
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,462
HE GAVE A FUNERAL SPEECH

769
00:41:40,497 --> 00:41:43,232
AND BASICALLY ASKED
THE PEOPLE HERE TO MOVE ON.

770
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:45,534
FOR THOSE WHO HAVE PASSED
THEIR LIFE HERE,

771
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:49,038
IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO DEPART
INTO THE LIGHT.

772
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:52,774
LEAVE THOSE WHO HEREIN LIVE,

773
00:41:52,809 --> 00:41:55,645
CAROL, ROBERT, AND THEIR FAMILY,
IN PEACE.

774
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,182
WE WISH YOU TO GO ON,
TO BE AT PEACE,

775
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:01,317
TO BE AT REST, AMEN.

776
00:42:03,353 --> 00:42:06,022
NOW THAT WE HAD THE CEREMONY,

777
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:08,590
I HOPE THAT ALL THE DEAD

778
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:11,996
THAT ARE IN THIS HOUSE CAN--
CAN GO REST IN PEACE.

779
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:15,966
I'M SO GLAD
THAT CAROL AND ROBERT

780
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:19,134
FINALLY TOOK MY ADVICE.

781
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:22,973
DESPITE SO MUCH TRAGEDY
SURROUNDING THEIR HOUSE,

782
00:42:23,008 --> 00:42:24,906
I'M CONFIDENT
THAT THESE BLESSINGS

783
00:42:24,941 --> 00:42:27,810
WILL HELP PEARLE
AND THE OTHERS MOVE ON.
