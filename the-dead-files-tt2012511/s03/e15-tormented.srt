Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:05,336 --> 00:00:09,536
I'm seeing a female losing her mind.

3
00:00:10,732 --> 00:00:14,122
There's a struggle on
whose house this is.

4
00:00:14,123 --> 00:00:17,258
I see attacks every day, every day.

5
00:00:17,259 --> 00:00:21,229
- We're kind of trapped.
- Then I hear "death".

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,605
Do you think there's any
foul play involved here?

7
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:25,167
It might be a poltergeist.

8
00:00:25,168 --> 00:00:27,753
I feel like it's watching me.

9
00:00:27,754 --> 00:00:30,656
"Mine, mine. Back the [Bleep] off".

10
00:00:30,657 --> 00:00:32,178
I want to have my home back.

11
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:35,659
I encountered a poltergeist.

12
00:00:38,365 --> 00:00:40,677
They're being watched.

13
00:00:40,678 --> 00:00:43,585
My name is Amy Allan.

14
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:45,836
This thing likes death.

15
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,619
I see dead people.

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,187
This thing is, like, a monster.

17
00:00:49,188 --> 00:00:51,257
I speak to dead people.

18
00:00:51,258 --> 00:00:52,947
And he's pissed off now.

19
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:54,456
And they speak to me.

20
00:00:54,457 --> 00:00:56,052
His head was cracked.

21
00:00:56,053 --> 00:00:59,032
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

22
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:01,082
This guy was murdered.

23
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:02,501
I rely on my partner.

24
00:01:02,502 --> 00:01:03,905
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

25
00:01:03,906 --> 00:01:05,856
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

26
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,574
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

27
00:01:08,575 --> 00:01:11,667
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

28
00:01:11,668 --> 00:01:14,580
You saw her? It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:15,733
Why would you stay here?

30
00:01:15,734 --> 00:01:17,857
But Steve and I never speak...

31
00:01:17,858 --> 00:01:19,841
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:19,842 --> 00:01:21,253
Until the very end.

33
00:01:21,254 --> 00:01:23,027
Stop it.

34
00:01:23,028 --> 00:01:25,191
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

35
00:01:25,192 --> 00:01:27,596
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

36
00:01:27,597 --> 00:01:28,961
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:28,962 --> 00:01:33,702
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

38
00:01:48,497 --> 00:01:53,117
Amy and I investigate
each case separately.

39
00:01:54,148 --> 00:01:58,110
I uncover a property's history and
question the witnesses involved.

40
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:01,711
While Amy talks to the dead.

41
00:02:02,724 --> 00:02:08,624
When we're done, we reveal our
findings to our client and each other.

42
00:02:16,862 --> 00:02:18,666
I'm in Westminster, Colorado.

43
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:21,735
It's a sleepy little suburb
about 20 minutes north of Denver.

44
00:02:21,736 --> 00:02:25,539
I received a call from a woman
named Cara, who's a single mom.

45
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,610
She tells me her entire family's
afraid to be in the house alone.

46
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:31,912
She does not sound good.

47
00:02:31,913 --> 00:02:36,353
I'm hoping Amy and I can help her out.

48
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:48,948
Before Amy can start her walk,

49
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:54,200
I need to make sure she is free
from any outside influences.

50
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:57,173
This house is filled with photographs
of a mother and her young children,

51
00:02:57,174 --> 00:03:00,473
that have to be covered or removed.

52
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:04,434
When I'm finished, Amy can begin.

53
00:03:37,357 --> 00:03:41,437
I'm seeing a female freaking out...

54
00:03:42,702 --> 00:03:45,402
Losing her mind.

55
...
...
...
603
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:20,002
She'll be taken care of, like, kind
of inadvertently through this process.

604
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:23,028
And then the last thing is
dealing with the PK manifestation,

605
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:27,212
that's, you know,
upstairs in your closet.

606
00:40:27,213 --> 00:40:30,836
What you want to do is a
little bit of counseling,

607
00:40:30,837 --> 00:40:33,269
just to work out those past issues.

608
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:37,048
So, you're taking it outside
of the house to a person...

609
00:40:37,049 --> 00:40:38,691
- Rather than in here.
- Right.

610
00:40:38,692 --> 00:40:41,768
And you're verbalizing
it out to that therapist.

611
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:44,039
Will it ever go away?

612
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,572
Um, no.

613
00:40:45,573 --> 00:40:51,114
I mean, it, very slowly over a very
long period of time, could dissipate.

614
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,526
So as long as you keep
it stunted, it's great.

615
00:40:54,527 --> 00:40:56,926
What about this guy John Shannon?

616
00:40:56,927 --> 00:41:02,747
Till this stuff gets resolved,
are they gonna be all right?

617
00:41:04,886 --> 00:41:08,671
Yes. You know your power over him.

618
00:41:08,672 --> 00:41:12,947
And so you just need to start
exerting that like nobody's business.

619
00:41:12,948 --> 00:41:15,743
And also tell your
children to do the same.

620
00:41:15,744 --> 00:41:18,846
- So you're empowering them.
- Mm hmm.

621
00:41:18,847 --> 00:41:21,682
Well, Cara, you're gonna
do what she tells you.

622
00:41:21,683 --> 00:41:25,043
- Definitely, yes.
- Okay.

623
00:41:27,823 --> 00:41:33,460
I truly believe the PK manifestation
poses a dangerous threat to Cara's family.

624
00:41:33,461 --> 00:41:36,581
If she follows the steps I
outlined, it will slowly dissolve,

625
00:41:36,582 --> 00:41:41,028
and she and her two kids can
live in their home in peace.
