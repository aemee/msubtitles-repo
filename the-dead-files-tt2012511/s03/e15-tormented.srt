Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:05,336 --> 00:00:09,536
I'm seeing a female losing her mind.

3
00:00:10,732 --> 00:00:14,122
There's a struggle on
whose house this is.

4
00:00:14,123 --> 00:00:17,258
I see attacks every day, every day.

5
00:00:17,259 --> 00:00:21,229
- We're kind of trapped.
- Then I hear "death".

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,605
Do you think there's any
foul play involved here?

7
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:25,167
It might be a poltergeist.

8
00:00:25,168 --> 00:00:27,753
I feel like it's watching me.

9
00:00:27,754 --> 00:00:30,656
"Mine, mine. Back the [Bleep] off".

10
00:00:30,657 --> 00:00:32,178
I want to have my home back.

11
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:35,659
I encountered a poltergeist.

12
00:00:38,365 --> 00:00:40,677
They're being watched.

13
00:00:40,678 --> 00:00:43,585
My name is Amy Allan.

14
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:45,836
This thing likes death.

15
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,619
I see dead people.

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,187
This thing is, like, a monster.

17
00:00:49,188 --> 00:00:51,257
I speak to dead people.

18
00:00:51,258 --> 00:00:52,947
And he's pissed off now.

19
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:54,456
And they speak to me.

20
00:00:54,457 --> 00:00:56,052
His head was cracked.

21
00:00:56,053 --> 00:00:59,032
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

22
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:01,082
This guy was murdered.

23
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:02,501
I rely on my partner.

24
00:01:02,502 --> 00:01:03,905
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

25
00:01:03,906 --> 00:01:05,856
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

26
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,574
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

27
00:01:08,575 --> 00:01:11,667
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

28
00:01:11,668 --> 00:01:14,580
You saw her? It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:15,733
Why would you stay here?

30
00:01:15,734 --> 00:01:17,857
But Steve and I never speak...

31
00:01:17,858 --> 00:01:19,841
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:19,842 --> 00:01:21,253
Until the very end.

33
00:01:21,254 --> 00:01:23,027
Stop it.

34
00:01:23,028 --> 00:01:25,191
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

35
00:01:25,192 --> 00:01:27,596
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

36
00:01:27,597 --> 00:01:28,961
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:28,962 --> 00:01:33,702
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

38
00:01:48,497 --> 00:01:53,117
Amy and I investigate
each case separately.

39
00:01:54,148 --> 00:01:58,110
I uncover a property's history and
question the witnesses involved.

40
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:01,711
While Amy talks to the dead.

41
00:02:02,724 --> 00:02:08,624
When we're done, we reveal our
findings to our client and each other.

42
00:02:16,862 --> 00:02:18,666
I'm in Westminster, Colorado.

43
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:21,735
It's a sleepy little suburb
about 20 minutes north of Denver.

44
00:02:21,736 --> 00:02:25,539
I received a call from a woman
named Cara, who's a single mom.

45
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,610
She tells me her entire family's
afraid to be in the house alone.

46
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:31,912
She does not sound good.

47
00:02:31,913 --> 00:02:36,353
I'm hoping Amy and I can help her out.

48
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:48,948
Before Amy can start her walk,

49
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:54,200
I need to make sure she is free
from any outside influences.

50
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:57,173
This house is filled with photographs
of a mother and her young children,

51
00:02:57,174 --> 00:03:00,473
that have to be covered or removed.

52
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:04,434
When I'm finished, Amy can begin.

53
00:03:37,357 --> 00:03:41,437
I'm seeing a female freaking out...

54
00:03:42,702 --> 00:03:45,402
Losing her mind.

55
00:03:46,545 --> 00:03:50,325
Something with, like, the walls.

56
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:55,261
I just see her jumping
around and, like, screaming

57
00:03:55,262 --> 00:03:58,669
and, like, then looking at the wall.

58
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:04,570
The lady who's freaking out is
alive, and they're being attacked.

59
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:09,061
It's really bad in here.

60
00:04:27,762 --> 00:04:30,523
Cara, I got to tell you... you
sounded pretty concerned on the phone.

61
00:04:30,524 --> 00:04:32,227
Uh, why don't you tell
me what's going on?

62
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:37,104
Well, I'm a single parent, and I'm
here with my two children by myself.

63
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:39,606
We have footsteps, voices.

64
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:42,710
Um, we're seeing things, hearing
things, things are moving.

65
00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:45,279
- How old are your kids?
- 8 and 10.

66
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,954
It's really hard to have a 10-year-old
who's very fearful in his own home, and...

67
00:04:50,955 --> 00:04:54,072
And just it definitely
has affected him the most.

68
00:04:54,073 --> 00:04:56,590
He won't go anywhere in the
home without somebody with him.

69
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:58,358
How long has this been going on?

70
00:04:58,359 --> 00:05:02,129
The entire time that we've lived
here... about ten and a half years.

71
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,652
However, when my ex-husband
moved out, the activity got worse.

72
00:05:05,653 --> 00:05:07,835
So that's why we called you in.

73
00:05:07,836 --> 00:05:11,067
What do you know about the house? I mean,
when was it built, anything like that?

74
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:16,054
I know it was built in 1985. No
one's lived here more than two years.

75
00:05:16,055 --> 00:05:19,185
I'm the only one who has
stuck it out this long.

76
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:22,294
You mentioned you were a nurse on the
phone, so what kind of a nurse are you?

77
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:28,099
I'm a hospice nurse, dealing with people
who have six months or less to live.

78
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,901
It's really emotionally draining.

79
00:05:29,902 --> 00:05:31,836
So, you're living here 10 years.

80
00:05:31,837 --> 00:05:35,840
You've been dealing with this almost ever
since you moved in. Dealt with a divorce.

81
00:05:35,841 --> 00:05:37,575
You're raising two kids on your own.

82
00:05:37,576 --> 00:05:39,744
I mean, how are you dealing with it?

83
00:05:39,745 --> 00:05:45,645
Well, it's incredibly stressful.
I want to have my home back.

84
00:05:48,403 --> 00:05:51,373
There is an old lady here.

85
00:05:51,374 --> 00:05:56,793
There is a relationship here with her
and this living woman who flipped out.

86
00:05:56,794 --> 00:06:00,926
She's tormented, and this old
lady... I think she's trying to help,

87
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,584
but she doesn't even know
where to begin to help.

88
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:05,271
To help what?

89
00:06:05,272 --> 00:06:09,472
Something is [Bleep] with people here.

90
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,691
It might not be a dead person.

91
00:06:14,243 --> 00:06:17,663
It might be a poltergeist.

92
00:06:25,174 --> 00:06:27,306
So, what's going on in
this part of the house?

93
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:30,741
When my son was younger, he
actually used to talk to a man

94
00:06:30,742 --> 00:06:35,952
that he saw in the ceiling
right over that chair over there.

95
00:06:35,953 --> 00:06:40,139
He would talk to him and tell
him to get down off the ceiling.

96
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,454
And it was just really creepy.

97
00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:43,756
Wow. Okay.

98
00:06:43,757 --> 00:06:47,593
We've had 8 floods in the last 10 years.

99
00:06:47,594 --> 00:06:49,516
What kind of floods? What
are you talking about?

100
00:06:49,517 --> 00:06:52,269
Floods like pipes breaking,
sump pumps failing.

101
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,839
We even had a manhole cover out
on the street flood my backyard.

102
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,543
What about your neighbors?

103
00:06:57,544 --> 00:07:00,846
As far as I know, none
of them have had floods.

104
00:07:00,847 --> 00:07:02,192
Anything else going on?

105
00:07:02,193 --> 00:07:06,382
I had two groups come and investigate,
but they weren't really able to help me.

106
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:07,784
They did some cleansing.

107
00:07:07,785 --> 00:07:10,693
They also did salt
crosses with the salt water

108
00:07:10,694 --> 00:07:14,241
and the lines in the doorway
to keep out the activity.

109
00:07:14,242 --> 00:07:16,283
So, did things get any
better after they left?

110
00:07:16,284 --> 00:07:21,204
No, nothing has worked.
We're kind of trapped.

111
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:32,117
I feel that there's violence
inflicted on these people.

112
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,987
That feeling of, like,
you've been, like, tortured.

113
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:39,042
So far, this walk is really strange.

114
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:41,044
I can tell someone is suffering,

115
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:44,862
but whatever's responsible
won't reveal itself to me.

116
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:50,323
There is really something
they're going through, but...

117
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:53,829
But I don't know what it is.

118
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:58,243
I feel their, like,
panic and their stress.

119
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,696
Like, I almost feel like
someone's suicidal because of this.

120
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:04,218
It's almost like in an
abusive relationship,

121
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:05,989
and you're being beat every day.

122
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:11,890
You're not afraid of it, you
know it's gonna happen anyways.

123
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,218
So, what's going on in here?

124
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:24,168
One of the first things that
I saw after moving in here

125
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:28,425
was a big glowing orb come from
my bathroom while I was in bed.

126
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:32,897
And it was bright, like the sun,
and it was big, almost person-size.

127
00:08:32,898 --> 00:08:36,499
And it stayed there for a long
time. It felt like forever.

128
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,889
Okay, were you in bed alone?

129
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,686
I actually was sleeping
with my son, Noah.

130
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:42,861
I gotta ask you a question, though, do
you take any kind of sleeping medication,

131
00:08:42,862 --> 00:08:45,696
so you may get hallucinations
from it or anything like that?

132
00:08:45,697 --> 00:08:46,633
No.

133
00:08:46,634 --> 00:08:48,763
So, have you experienced
anything else in the room?

134
00:08:48,764 --> 00:08:52,433
I also have felt like something
was crawling up my bed,

135
00:08:52,434 --> 00:08:55,870
almost like someone was crawling
over me, going up the bed.

136
00:08:55,871 --> 00:08:58,977
I could feel the sheets
being pulled tight around me.

137
00:08:58,978 --> 00:09:01,594
Then I yelled at it to go away.

138
00:09:01,595 --> 00:09:04,097
- And did it stop?
- It did stop.

139
00:09:04,098 --> 00:09:07,113
After all you've told me, I find it
amazing that you could still live here,

140
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:09,027
I mean, you don't have
a safe spot in the house.

141
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:12,077
No. And I almost feel like I'm in a

142
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:15,918
struggle on whose house this is.

143
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:28,955
Oh [Bleep]

144
00:09:30,074 --> 00:09:32,294
Ooh. Ooh.

145
00:09:34,892 --> 00:09:36,812
Okay.

146
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:41,681
Yeah, I feel like the
attack's every day, every day.

147
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:45,352
Who the [Bleep] is doing this?

148
00:09:45,353 --> 00:09:51,253
I think that it's the beginnings
of a poltergeist manifestation.

149
00:09:52,747 --> 00:09:56,527
It's needing a lot of feeding.

150
00:09:57,565 --> 00:10:01,043
If this thing is fully
formed, can it hurt people?

151
00:10:01,044 --> 00:10:03,437
Yes, absolutely.

152
00:10:03,438 --> 00:10:07,166
You know, it can cut them, start fires.

153
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:09,747
It could rape.

154
00:10:09,801 --> 00:10:12,123
And beat people.

155
00:10:12,124 --> 00:10:16,564
It can be very, very brutal and violent.

156
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:30,708
I think that it's the beginnings
of a poltergeist manifestation.

157
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:35,473
It can start fires...

158
00:10:35,474 --> 00:10:37,990
Rape and beat people.

159
00:10:37,991 --> 00:10:41,627
So, yeah, it can be very,
very brutal and violent.

160
00:10:41,628 --> 00:10:45,633
- You're pretty sure this is a poltergeist?
- Yes, absolutely.

161
00:10:45,634 --> 00:10:48,467
Poltergeists are usually
created unintentionally,

162
00:10:48,468 --> 00:10:53,129
when someone with psychic abilities
represses intense negative emotions.

163
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,679
These entities can interact
with the physical world,

164
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,246
and if the poltergeist develops,
it could become extremely dangerous.

165
00:11:00,247 --> 00:11:03,139
But this [Bleep] is, like...

166
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,300
Mindless.

167
00:11:07,173 --> 00:11:13,073
Its creator is living, and it'll
do whatever the creator wants it to.

168
00:11:23,074 --> 00:11:24,704
So, Kymber, I was talking with mom,

169
00:11:24,705 --> 00:11:27,978
and I understand you and your brother
have had some experiences yourself.

170
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:31,482
Yeah. There's been things
I've seen downstairs.

171
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:35,319
I've heard footsteps in the stairs, and
I saw a witch on the wall over there.

172
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,107
You saw a witch?

173
00:11:37,108 --> 00:11:40,717
You couldn't really see her face and...

174
00:11:40,718 --> 00:11:43,625
Her face was covered with black hair.

175
00:11:43,626 --> 00:11:48,204
So, this woman...
how'd she make you feel?

176
00:11:48,205 --> 00:11:51,541
I wanted to leave this room right now.

177
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:55,585
I was just shaking and
hiding under the covers.

178
00:11:55,586 --> 00:11:58,622
How active is it in your
room, does it happen a lot?

179
00:11:58,623 --> 00:12:01,865
- Will you hear things?
- Well, it's not really active in my room.

180
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:05,072
It's more active in Noah's room.

181
00:12:05,073 --> 00:12:08,392
And it's mostly active in my mom's room.

182
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:10,313
Okay.

183
00:12:14,236 --> 00:12:17,416
There's this old lady.

184
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:20,553
I get "grandma, grandma, grandma".

185
00:12:20,554 --> 00:12:23,434
She's here a lot.

186
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:31,251
It doesn't feel as bad
as the other room...

187
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:33,352
At all.

188
00:12:36,202 --> 00:12:39,502
It feels better in here.

189
00:12:39,862 --> 00:12:42,442
Safer in here.

190
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:47,613
Uh because she's like,
she's always in here.

191
00:12:47,614 --> 00:12:52,417
I mean, she's trying to protect and
make it good for whoever's in here.

192
00:12:52,418 --> 00:12:54,119
What is she protecting against?

193
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,387
I don't know.

194
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:58,928
Something really, really bad.

195
00:13:11,927 --> 00:13:15,641
Kymber told me that her brother was
experiencing more activity in his room.

196
00:13:15,642 --> 00:13:17,109
According to their mom,

197
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,212
Noah's actually afraid to be
alone anywhere in the house.

198
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:22,895
I'm gonna have to hear his story.

199
00:13:22,896 --> 00:13:28,637
I'm scared to just be upstairs
alone by myself all the time.

200
00:13:28,638 --> 00:13:33,018
The one thing that scares me is that...

201
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,835
Behind my door over there um...

202
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,832
There's this thing that's...

203
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:44,937
It's just very scary. Like,
I feel like it's watching me.

204
00:13:44,938 --> 00:13:47,517
- It's, like, a shadow kind of.
- Okay.

205
00:13:47,518 --> 00:13:51,804
And the edges of it are kind of like...
they kind of, like, fade a little bit.

206
00:13:51,805 --> 00:13:55,691
I don't know if it's...
it feels pretty negative.

207
00:13:55,692 --> 00:13:58,107
It doesn't seem very friendly.

208
00:13:58,108 --> 00:14:00,519
Okay, you having trouble
sleeping at night because of that?

209
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,576
Yeah, it's...

210
00:14:02,577 --> 00:14:04,917
Very scary.

211
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,220
Ooh. Ooh.

212
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:19,199
Oh.

213
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,000
Okay, we got something
with the closets here.

214
00:14:25,685 --> 00:14:28,320
Is it the same thing you
saw in the other closet?

215
00:14:28,321 --> 00:14:30,889
It's something different.

216
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,563
But it's weird because it's every night.

217
00:14:33,564 --> 00:14:37,224
It's like a nightly creation.

218
00:14:44,631 --> 00:14:48,348
But I think that he's mostly seen as...

219
00:14:48,349 --> 00:14:52,669
Like, a shadow man or a shadow person.

220
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:56,068
So, is this guy pretty
much just in the closet?

221
00:14:56,069 --> 00:15:00,095
I just get like it's
kind of his own space.

222
00:15:00,096 --> 00:15:03,996
And it does scare someone a lot.

223
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,851
This is where he likes to
be, so it just so happens

224
00:15:09,852 --> 00:15:13,647
that whoever's in this room
would get more frightened

225
00:15:13,648 --> 00:15:19,228
than everybody else, because
he's more consistently here.

226
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:22,895
One morning, I woke up.

227
00:15:22,896 --> 00:15:27,007
There was, like, a light, like somebody
was shining a flashlight under my door.

228
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:30,332
And there's just, like, a little crack,
so you could barely, like, see it.

229
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,289
Okay.

230
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:36,453
So, I open the door, and it was like
a glowing, like, light, circle thing.

231
00:15:36,454 --> 00:15:42,354
I saw it for like a second or two and
I, like, scared it or something and it...

232
00:15:42,783 --> 00:15:43,769
Okay.

233
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,071
Now, how you dealing with all
this stuff that's going on?

234
00:15:46,072 --> 00:15:48,374
I'm kind of very cautious of upstairs.

235
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:52,657
Like, it's very hard
to be up here alone.

236
00:15:52,658 --> 00:15:56,738
Like, I always want Kymber with me.

237
00:15:57,118 --> 00:16:00,718
- It's really scary.
- Okay.

238
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:07,932
This guy is the tormentor.

239
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:11,722
So, there's a woman and then...

240
00:16:11,723 --> 00:16:14,081
This kid who he,

241
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:16,307
really just torments.

242
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,622
Like, I feel like he can
put weight on the bed.

243
00:16:19,623 --> 00:16:25,083
You know like, it feels like
somebody's sitting there.

244
00:16:27,865 --> 00:16:30,133
A lot of movement around him.

245
00:16:30,134 --> 00:16:33,554
I feel all of this dread.

246
00:16:33,786 --> 00:16:37,022
Do you know why he does that?

247
00:16:37,023 --> 00:16:41,076
This tormentor feels
like he's being invaded.

248
00:16:41,077 --> 00:16:43,111
So, what makes you say that?

249
00:16:43,112 --> 00:16:45,790
There was, like, this moment of, like...

250
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,191
"Mine, mine.

251
00:16:48,361 --> 00:16:51,510
This is my people, mine".

252
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:55,051
And, "back the [Bleep] off".

253
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:07,647
Cara's house is only 27 years old.

254
00:17:07,648 --> 00:17:08,967
I looked into its history,

255
00:17:08,968 --> 00:17:11,785
and I couldn't find any deaths
associated with the property.

256
00:17:11,786 --> 00:17:14,585
So I'm headed over to meet with
a prominent real-estate developer

257
00:17:14,586 --> 00:17:20,466
to see what was on the land
before Cara's house was there.

258
00:17:24,331 --> 00:17:28,152
The house I'm investigating was built
in 1985, and I know you're a developer.

259
00:17:28,153 --> 00:17:31,971
Can you give me an idea what was
there prior to the houses being built?

260
00:17:31,972 --> 00:17:34,941
More or less, what was
there was just what you see.

261
00:17:34,942 --> 00:17:39,562
It was open farmland
for dry land grazing.

262
00:17:39,661 --> 00:17:41,378
Who owned the land back then?

263
00:17:41,379 --> 00:17:46,086
My grandfather, who, in 1869,
decided to start Church Ranch.

264
00:17:46,087 --> 00:17:48,888
It had to be tough back in
those days to get a farm going.

265
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:54,647
Well, the standard worries were, obviously,
food and water to drink and shelter.

266
00:17:54,648 --> 00:17:57,685
Our family was very involved
in bringing the first water

267
00:17:57,686 --> 00:18:02,035
down from the Continental
Divide to this eastern slope.

268
00:18:02,036 --> 00:18:03,592
Life wasn't easy here.

269
00:18:03,593 --> 00:18:06,540
It was very challenging.
Farming's still challenging.

270
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:10,767
You can have an accident, where somebody
gets hurt by a piece of machinery

271
00:18:10,768 --> 00:18:12,672
or falls into an irrigation ditch.

272
00:18:12,673 --> 00:18:14,189
That was not uncommon.

273
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,592
Now, were they any deaths
associated with all that work?

274
00:18:16,593 --> 00:18:20,228
There were many deaths
associated with irrigation.

275
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:23,157
One of the ones in this local
area that I've heard about

276
00:18:23,158 --> 00:18:29,058
was a fella by the name of John
Shannon that fell in and drowned.

277
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:40,516
These two men are talking.

278
00:18:40,517 --> 00:18:46,277
Somebody's saying, "having a
problem keeping animals alive".

279
00:18:47,455 --> 00:18:49,366
They're very, very stressed out.

280
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:51,409
Do you know what he's worried about?

281
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,852
Then he's talking about
water, like water flow...

282
00:18:54,853 --> 00:18:57,760
And being ruined financially.

283
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,708
- Why?
- Because the animals are dying.

284
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:00,597
Okay.

285
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:05,878
Well, one of the guys
looks kind of like that guy.

286
00:19:06,076 --> 00:19:09,121
This dead farmer is
angry that I'm seeing him.

287
00:19:09,122 --> 00:19:13,826
I realize now this guy is the
tormentor hiding in the kid's closet.

288
00:19:13,827 --> 00:19:18,054
He's just pretending to be a
shadow figure to protect his space.

289
00:19:18,055 --> 00:19:19,580
He's got a cowboy hat on.

290
00:19:19,581 --> 00:19:22,101
He's got a plaid button-down
long-sleeve shirt.

291
00:19:22,102 --> 00:19:25,882
He's got jeans and a belt on.

292
00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:39,809
He's created this monster
of himself from himself.

293
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:49,071
I saw the word...

294
00:19:49,072 --> 00:19:51,172
"Death".

295
00:20:00,606 --> 00:20:03,608
I've managed to track down
a descendant of John Shannon,

296
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:05,845
the man who died in a
local irrigation ditch.

297
00:20:05,846 --> 00:20:09,073
And she tells me her great-grandfather
lived a colorful life,

298
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:12,794
and his death was no accident.

299
00:20:18,124 --> 00:20:20,975
So, I understand you're a
descendant of John Shannon's.

300
00:20:20,976 --> 00:20:23,306
Yes, I'm his great-granddaughter.

301
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:27,833
Here's some pictures
of my great-grandfather.

302
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:29,585
What can you tell me about him?

303
00:20:29,586 --> 00:20:33,865
The oldest boy, before he died, told my
grandma that he remembers he'd have to

304
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,984
take the younger boys and
hide them down by the creek

305
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:40,065
so their father wouldn't beat them.

306
00:20:40,247 --> 00:20:43,249
He was mean to the kids. He
was mean to the farm animals.

307
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,117
- Really?
- Yeah.

308
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:49,387
He had beat one of the horses so bad
that somebody had to pull him off.

309
00:20:49,388 --> 00:20:51,242
- You're kidding.
- No.

310
00:20:51,243 --> 00:20:56,078
And then I do remember hearing that
when the youngest child was a newborn,

311
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:01,979
that the mother walked in and found
the father trying to smother the baby.

312
00:21:11,547 --> 00:21:13,578
The tormentor won't leave me alone,

313
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:17,052
and he's following me
down to the basement.

314
00:21:17,053 --> 00:21:19,585
And I'm feeling like...
there's like a...

315
00:21:19,586 --> 00:21:24,256
I think this is a kid being,
like, held down and smothered.

316
00:21:24,257 --> 00:21:27,077
He can't breathe.

317
00:21:28,628 --> 00:21:30,721
Seeing uh...

318
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:33,482
This dark mass...

319
00:21:37,066 --> 00:21:39,076
Standing...

320
00:21:39,077 --> 00:21:41,357
Smothering.

321
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:49,309
There's just some psycho
[Bleep] going on in this house.

322
00:21:50,995 --> 00:21:54,321
I heard a rumor that he may have
drowned in a ditch. Is that correct?

323
00:21:54,322 --> 00:21:58,942
My great-grandfather
died in July of 1936.

324
00:21:59,316 --> 00:22:02,694
He didn't come home for supper one
night, and so my great-grandmother

325
00:22:02,695 --> 00:22:05,370
had some of the local
men out looking for him.

326
00:22:05,371 --> 00:22:09,377
And they found his hat and
jacket by the irrigation ditch.

327
00:22:09,378 --> 00:22:11,220
And they drained the ditch and somebody,

328
00:22:11,221 --> 00:22:14,032
went down in there and
brought the body out.

329
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:16,781
And when I found the
death certificate here,

330
00:22:16,782 --> 00:22:19,078
it says the official cause is drowning.

331
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:22,014
But it does leave the question of...

332
00:22:22,015 --> 00:22:24,850
Did he have a heart attack
and fall in the ditch or...

333
00:22:24,851 --> 00:22:27,421
Do you think there's any
foul play involved here?

334
00:22:27,422 --> 00:22:29,482
I've wondered about the oldest boy.

335
00:22:29,483 --> 00:22:30,894
In what way?

336
00:22:30,895 --> 00:22:33,434
Because he was very
devoted to his mother.

337
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,493
The day that he ended up dead,

338
00:22:35,494 --> 00:22:39,613
there were people trying to get
the kids taken out of their custody.

339
00:22:39,614 --> 00:22:41,913
The day of his funeral,

340
00:22:41,914 --> 00:22:45,605
they all went home, and the oldest boy
said, "we don't ever talk about this".

341
00:22:45,606 --> 00:22:48,942
And great-grandma
never talked about it.

342
00:22:48,943 --> 00:22:50,803
Wow.

343
00:22:54,981 --> 00:22:57,149
And then that thing is behind me.

344
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,607
What thing?

345
00:22:58,608 --> 00:23:01,810
The dead guy from upstairs.

346
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:03,584
Okay.

347
00:23:03,585 --> 00:23:06,987
And is laughing hysterically.

348
00:23:06,988 --> 00:23:10,996
This tormentor from upstairs is furious
that I've seen through his disguise

349
00:23:10,997 --> 00:23:13,808
and can tell that he's not
actually a shadow figure.

350
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:17,719
He clearly wants me to
get out of the house.

351
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,100
He just followed me in from the garage.

352
00:23:23,676 --> 00:23:27,246
He's very, very, very angry.

353
00:23:27,247 --> 00:23:29,728
Oh, I don't feel good in here.

354
00:23:29,729 --> 00:23:32,746
This one's, like, really, really bad.

355
00:23:32,747 --> 00:23:36,121
He says, "oh, can't
breathe, can you? Ha ha".

356
00:23:36,122 --> 00:23:38,882
I can't breathe.

357
00:23:49,172 --> 00:23:51,295
After hearing about John Shannon,

358
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:55,266
I needed to see if there's any other
suspicious deaths related to the property.

359
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,568
As I'm looking through
the town's records,

360
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:02,073
I found that a young newlywed, Gertrude
Weaver, used to live on Cara's land.

361
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:07,311
She died while away on her
honeymoon, but the cause is unclear.

362
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:11,007
Newspaper reports list three
different causes of death...

363
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:15,590
Accident, suicide, and
homicide, all by gunshot.

364
00:24:15,591 --> 00:24:18,725
Now that I've got two mysterious
deaths on one property,

365
00:24:18,726 --> 00:24:24,626
I need to try to figure out
how Gertrude Weaver really died.

366
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:35,446
I just saw, like, someone walk by.

367
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:43,047
It was a woman, younger.

368
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,583
She might just be some
residual or something.

369
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:48,789
Like, there's no, like, interaction.

370
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:52,390
Can you describe her at all?

371
00:24:57,897 --> 00:25:01,365
She's wearing a nightgown that's white

372
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:04,797
with, like, little
design here or something

373
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:08,390
and little poufy sleeves,
like these, kind of.

374
00:25:08,391 --> 00:25:11,151
Gaunt face, long.

375
00:25:11,664 --> 00:25:16,344
And I kind of did hear
"suicide" with her.

376
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:20,371
All of the newspaper reports
say that Gertrude Weaver

377
00:25:20,372 --> 00:25:24,504
was shot by a gun her husband gave
her to use in case of an emergency.

378
00:25:24,505 --> 00:25:29,585
But the papers don't confirm if her death
was an accident, homicide, or suicide.

379
00:25:29,586 --> 00:25:31,704
So I'm meeting with
an antique gun expert

380
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:36,865
who says he can help me
figure out what happened.

381
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:45,774
Now, is this the same type of
weapon that killed Gertrude?

382
00:25:45,775 --> 00:25:48,175
Yes, it is.

383
00:26:03,551 --> 00:26:05,849
In your opinion, could
this have been an accident?

384
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:09,757
To have an accidental shooting with one
of these would be extremely difficult.

385
00:26:09,758 --> 00:26:12,867
What if it was cocked back and it's
leaning up against the wall, for instance?

386
00:26:12,868 --> 00:26:14,712
If it falls, would it go off?

387
00:26:14,713 --> 00:26:17,367
The chances of it going
off are almost nil.

388
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:18,870
It's not a hair trigger.

389
00:26:18,871 --> 00:26:21,835
You would actually have to pull the
trigger in order for the gun to go off.

390
00:26:21,836 --> 00:26:24,613
Okay, so we can rule out accidental.

391
00:26:24,614 --> 00:26:28,643
But as a general rule, women do
not kill themselves with a firearm.

392
00:26:28,644 --> 00:26:31,094
My opinion... somebody shot her.

393
00:26:31,095 --> 00:26:33,285
But we can't rule out suicide.

394
00:26:33,286 --> 00:26:35,842
Two reasons why I don't
think this was a suicide

395
00:26:35,843 --> 00:26:38,760
is the length of the rifle
and the weight of the rifle.

396
00:26:38,761 --> 00:26:40,605
Feel how heavy that is.

397
00:26:40,606 --> 00:26:42,749
Wow. It's heavier than it looks.

398
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,599
It's a 12 to 13 pound rifle.

399
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,808
I mean, a 21-year-old
small woman,

400
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:50,672
you know, in order to hold it like this
and get shot center-mass in the heart...

401
00:26:50,673 --> 00:26:54,095
I mean, she'd have to be 6'8 with 4-foot
arms in order to do that to herself.

402
00:26:54,096 --> 00:26:55,428
Right.

403
00:26:55,429 --> 00:26:58,481
But people can be really resourceful,
and if she wanted to do it,

404
00:26:58,482 --> 00:27:00,301
- she could have rigged something.
- Yeah.

405
00:27:00,302 --> 00:27:02,751
She'd have to prop it
up somehow or rig it.

406
00:27:02,752 --> 00:27:04,663
I've seen people put
their toes in the friggin'

407
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,885
trigger guard and blow their brains out.

408
00:27:06,886 --> 00:27:12,106
Who knows what was going
through this girl's head?

409
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,793
During my walk, I
watched an old dead woman

410
00:27:22,794 --> 00:27:26,509
trying to protect a panicked living
woman from a dangerous entity.

411
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:31,497
I'm working with a sketch
artist to describe what I saw.

412
00:27:31,498 --> 00:27:37,398
There is a woman who's kneeling
on the couch facing the wall.

413
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:45,169
She has her hands up on the
top of the back of the couch.

414
00:27:45,221 --> 00:27:48,811
And then there's, like,
a little old lady who...

415
00:27:48,812 --> 00:27:51,632
Is standing close.

416
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:55,267
- Describe this woman for me.
- Okay.

417
00:27:55,268 --> 00:27:59,748
She was pretty old, so
she's fairly wrinkled.

418
00:27:59,749 --> 00:28:03,949
And she's wearing big, thick glasses.

419
00:28:04,886 --> 00:28:07,763
Can you tell me anything
more about the hairstyle?

420
00:28:07,764 --> 00:28:12,264
It kind of stands up, but it curls back.

421
00:28:15,592 --> 00:28:18,712
Is this what you saw?

422
00:28:19,451 --> 00:28:21,311
Yes.

423
00:28:41,497 --> 00:28:44,556
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

424
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:49,728
we're ready to reveal our
findings for the first time.

425
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:51,697
Cara, it's good to see you again.

426
00:28:51,698 --> 00:28:54,277
I want to introduce
you to my partner, Amy.

427
00:28:54,278 --> 00:28:57,720
Cara lives here. She's a
single mom with two children.

428
00:28:57,721 --> 00:28:59,711
The three of them are
living in terror here.

429
00:28:59,712 --> 00:29:03,453
Her oldest son, Noah, is
probably the most affected by it.

430
00:29:03,454 --> 00:29:05,497
He's afraid to be in the house alone.

431
00:29:05,498 --> 00:29:08,833
He has to sleep with the light on,
can't have his friends over to the house,

432
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:11,686
and she feels it's
destroying his childhood.

433
00:29:11,687 --> 00:29:13,771
With that being said, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy,

434
00:29:13,772 --> 00:29:18,572
so we can hear a little
bit about her walk.

435
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,295
When I walked into the
house, I saw a woman.

436
00:29:26,296 --> 00:29:28,214
She's a living person.

437
00:29:28,215 --> 00:29:30,449
And she was just flipping out.

438
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,413
She was screaming and
yelling and out of control.

439
00:29:33,414 --> 00:29:37,914
I was seeing everything
through her eyes.

440
00:29:38,394 --> 00:29:44,294
The lady who's freaking out is
alive, and they're being attacked.

441
00:29:45,765 --> 00:29:49,125
It's really bad in here.

442
00:29:49,302 --> 00:29:54,725
The other person that was there was
this little old lady that is dead,

443
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:58,110
and she's a conscious entity.

444
00:29:58,111 --> 00:30:02,981
I feel, definitely, a
female presence in the house.

445
00:30:02,982 --> 00:30:05,642
I did sketch the scene that I saw.

446
00:30:05,643 --> 00:30:08,357
- The scene of what? The two women?
- Of the two women.

447
00:30:08,358 --> 00:30:11,222
You saw the living woman
and the dead woman together?

448
00:30:11,223 --> 00:30:13,083
Yes.

449
00:30:16,012 --> 00:30:17,872
Wow.

450
00:30:23,752 --> 00:30:26,812
Take a look at that.

451
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:36,184
So, the person in the
background is a living woman.

452
00:30:36,185 --> 00:30:40,526
And she was really being tormented
by whatever was happening.

453
00:30:40,527 --> 00:30:46,427
The impression I got was something moving
by or something that was scaring her.

454
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:51,300
And this is the old lady who's dead.

455
00:30:51,301 --> 00:30:53,682
That's very scary.

456
00:30:53,683 --> 00:30:57,413
I'm a hospice nurse, and
so I deal with death...

457
00:30:57,414 --> 00:30:59,794
- All of the time.
- Oh, man.

458
00:30:59,795 --> 00:31:04,865
It could be a lady that I
had pass about a year ago...

459
00:31:04,866 --> 00:31:09,042
- Oh, wow.
- That I really cared about.

460
00:31:09,043 --> 00:31:11,759
She's very, very protective
of the lavender room

461
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,590
and spends a large
amount of time in there...

462
00:31:14,591 --> 00:31:19,151
Uh, just sitting and
being, like, calming.

463
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:21,205
That's your daughter's room,

464
00:31:21,206 --> 00:31:26,606
and she seems to be the
least affected in the house.

465
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,437
There's another woman here.

466
00:31:29,438 --> 00:31:34,973
She was a younger woman and
she had long light-brown hair.

467
00:31:34,974 --> 00:31:39,954
And when she was walking
by, I heard "suicide".

468
00:31:40,004 --> 00:31:44,168
The house is only 27 years old,
so I looked into the land here.

469
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:48,819
Where your house sits was part
of a big, huge 17,000-acre farm,

470
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,270
set up into homesteads.

471
00:31:50,271 --> 00:31:54,068
And the turn of the century, there was
a woman by the name of Gertrude Weaver

472
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:57,210
who lived on the farmland here.

473
00:31:57,211 --> 00:32:00,031
This is her here.

474
00:32:02,204 --> 00:32:04,416
One day, they found her dead.

475
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:06,382
She was shot in the chest.

476
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:10,957
So, the newspaper articles on
Gertrude's death listed three causes...

477
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:14,126
Accidental, suicide, and homicide.

478
00:32:14,127 --> 00:32:17,428
I consulted with a rifle expert,
and he ruled out accidental.

479
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:20,749
But, in my opinion as
a homicide investigator,

480
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,721
I'm leaning towards homicide,
but I can't rule out suicide...

481
00:32:24,722 --> 00:32:28,562
- Whoa.
- Because it's possible.

482
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:31,369
Is she dangerous to Cara and her family?

483
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,527
No.

484
00:32:32,528 --> 00:32:37,091
But the next individual that I
encountered I believe is responsible

485
00:32:37,092 --> 00:32:42,612
for everything that is going
on in the house that's negative.

486
00:32:42,613 --> 00:32:45,487
He is the tormentor.

487
00:32:45,488 --> 00:32:49,812
I saw him trying to hold
down and smother a child.

488
00:32:49,813 --> 00:32:54,187
And then he made me feel
like I couldn't breathe.

489
00:32:54,188 --> 00:32:59,961
If somebody were to perceive him, it
would look more like a shadow person.

490
00:32:59,962 --> 00:33:05,862
He can go anywhere he wants in the house,
but he loves the blue room's closet.

491
00:33:06,297 --> 00:33:11,043
This is where he likes to be, so it just
so happens that whoever's in this room

492
00:33:11,044 --> 00:33:14,565
would get more frightened
than everybody else,

493
00:33:14,566 --> 00:33:17,023
because he's more consistently here.

494
00:33:17,024 --> 00:33:20,368
That describes what's going on
with your son to a "T" almost.

495
00:33:20,369 --> 00:33:25,064
Yeah, he sees a shadow person
beside his door all the time...

496
00:33:25,065 --> 00:33:25,983
Okay.

497
00:33:25,984 --> 00:33:29,168
Kind of like a blurry
edged shadow person.

498
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:29,969
Mm hmm.

499
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:35,244
And I can't even close the
door without him screaming.

500
00:33:35,245 --> 00:33:38,315
So, I go out into the backyard.

501
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:43,456
And I actually get to see his
true self when he was alive.

502
00:33:43,457 --> 00:33:45,883
He seemed to be some
type of farmer or rancher.

503
00:33:45,884 --> 00:33:50,325
He was really, really stressed
out about his water source

504
00:33:50,326 --> 00:33:55,457
and water issues that were
happening at that time.

505
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:57,728
We have water issues.

506
00:33:57,729 --> 00:34:01,178
I've had 8 separate floods
in 10 years in my home.

507
00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:03,901
Fixed pipes, multiple sump pumps,

508
00:34:03,902 --> 00:34:06,169
and then when everything
was fixed in the basement,

509
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:09,506
a manhole cover flooded my
basement, not any of my neighbors.

510
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:12,014
None of my neighbors
have had the issues.

511
00:34:12,015 --> 00:34:17,415
Most people lived here only
two years, except for me.

512
00:34:18,248 --> 00:34:22,993
He really believes that this is his
home, that you're his possessions,

513
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,021
and he...

514
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:27,542
Is an abuser.

515
00:34:27,828 --> 00:34:30,712
Amy, let me tell you about
this guy John Shannon.

516
00:34:30,713 --> 00:34:32,794
He was a lousy farmer.

517
00:34:32,795 --> 00:34:38,135
And his biggest worries was
irrigation and the water.

518
00:34:40,456 --> 00:34:43,342
- This is him as a farmer.
- Oh.

519
00:34:43,343 --> 00:34:47,483
- All right? And this is him.
- Oh.

520
00:34:48,104 --> 00:34:51,783
- There's a better photo of him up close.
- Whoa.

521
00:34:51,784 --> 00:34:56,490
I talked to his great-granddaughter,
and she told me...

522
00:34:56,491 --> 00:34:59,614
He beat a horse so bad, people
had to pull him off the horse.

523
00:34:59,615 --> 00:35:02,015
Oh, my God.

524
00:35:02,053 --> 00:35:04,419
Matter of fact, he abused his kids.

525
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,418
And it got to the point
where the older kids,

526
00:35:07,419 --> 00:35:09,923
would take the younger kids and
hide them when he'd come home,

527
00:35:09,924 --> 00:35:12,460
because they were so afraid
of him beating them down.

528
00:35:12,461 --> 00:35:15,920
The state was gonna come and take,

529
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:21,069
his eight children away from him and
his wife because he was so abusive.

530
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,982
John Shannon dies in July of 1936.

531
00:35:23,983 --> 00:35:28,183
And I got the death certificate here.

532
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:31,954
His cause of death is drowning.

533
00:35:31,955 --> 00:35:36,040
And they find him in a water ditch.

534
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:38,976
The great-granddaughter thinks
that maybe somebody murdered him.

535
00:35:38,977 --> 00:35:43,306
She had the feeling that the
oldest boy might have done it.

536
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:47,327
But do you think this is the guy?

537
00:35:49,354 --> 00:35:51,334
I do.

538
00:35:56,855 --> 00:36:00,677
The part that really concerned me was...

539
00:36:00,678 --> 00:36:05,838
I encountered the beginnings
of a PK manifestation.

540
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:11,276
That is a branch off of a poltergeist.

541
00:36:14,485 --> 00:36:17,834
These things cut people...

542
00:36:17,835 --> 00:36:20,290
Beat people up...

543
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:24,671
And it could also possibly kill someone.

544
00:36:34,474 --> 00:36:39,634
I encountered the beginnings
of a PK manifestation.

545
00:36:41,221 --> 00:36:45,541
That is a branch off of a poltergeist.

546
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,509
These things cut people...

547
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,922
Beat people up...

548
00:36:53,923 --> 00:36:58,303
And it could also possibly kill someone.

549
00:36:58,343 --> 00:37:00,937
Now, what happens
with a PK manifestation

550
00:37:00,938 --> 00:37:05,806
is that it stems from a
living agent at the location.

551
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:08,390
It's just purely the person's energy.

552
00:37:08,391 --> 00:37:10,626
It's not something you can see.

553
00:37:10,627 --> 00:37:14,438
These things feed off of negativity.

554
00:37:14,439 --> 00:37:19,168
Fear, anger, depression become
absorbed immediately into this.

555
00:37:19,169 --> 00:37:24,209
And then it starts to
actually create an entity.

556
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:29,366
It was initially created by a female.

557
00:37:29,367 --> 00:37:32,589
Who's going through a very intense time.

558
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:35,882
Do you know who formed
it or helped form it?

559
00:37:35,883 --> 00:37:37,628
Well, I think that it's...

560
00:37:37,629 --> 00:37:39,835
Yeah, probably me then.

561
00:37:39,836 --> 00:37:42,132
I have been through a lot of stress.

562
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:44,053
Okay.

563
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:48,683
So, does Cara have abilities?

564
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:50,593
Yes.

565
00:37:51,022 --> 00:37:54,082
And so does her son.

566
00:37:55,552 --> 00:37:58,236
So, you have abilities...

567
00:37:58,237 --> 00:38:02,489
You're in the house with dead people.

568
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:06,684
And you're under a
great amount of stress.

569
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:09,925
It's the perfect storm.

570
00:38:14,496 --> 00:38:17,965
Well, Cara, this is obviously
not what you wanted to hear,

571
00:38:17,966 --> 00:38:21,558
but the investigations
did give you the answers

572
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:23,857
as to why it's happening,
what's going on.

573
00:38:23,858 --> 00:38:27,465
The big question is, though... is it safe
for you and your children to stay here?

574
00:38:27,466 --> 00:38:32,026
For that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

575
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:35,121
So, I do believe that you can stay.

576
00:38:35,122 --> 00:38:36,778
Good, good.

577
00:38:36,779 --> 00:38:39,178
Because I can't sell this place.

578
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:42,918
But there are a few things
that you'll have to do.

579
00:38:42,919 --> 00:38:47,107
The first thing I want to
talk about is cleansing.

580
00:38:47,108 --> 00:38:51,403
Once a week, you physically clean
your house from top to bottom.

581
00:38:51,404 --> 00:38:53,695
When you say to clean
the house top to bottom,

582
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:56,452
you're talking about actually
cleaning it, like washing and cleaning,

583
00:38:56,453 --> 00:38:59,217
- mopping the floor, and vacuuming?
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

584
00:38:59,218 --> 00:39:03,139
With your situation, the
cleansing is more for,

585
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,654
getting rid of the residual
energy that's collected.

586
00:39:06,655 --> 00:39:08,554
Mm-hmm.

587
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:10,769
When people experience intense trauma,

588
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:15,060
toxic residual energy can pile
up in their environment like dust.

589
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,873
By cleaning the surfaces of her home,

590
00:39:16,874 --> 00:39:20,609
Cara will wash these layers
of negative energy away.

591
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:26,510
So, you clean the space out and then
you're going to deal with this guy.

592
00:39:27,443 --> 00:39:32,135
The way that I would suggest doing that
is getting a physical medium in here.

593
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:35,596
And you're going to
work with that person on,

594
00:39:35,597 --> 00:39:40,178
visualizing him out of the
house to move him out and on.

595
00:39:40,179 --> 00:39:44,859
Exert your power, let
him know who's boss.

596
00:39:45,419 --> 00:39:48,329
After he's gone, am I gonna
still feel him, that's the thing,

597
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:49,971
- or is it just gonna feel...
- Oh, no.

598
00:39:49,972 --> 00:39:53,185
Because you're gonna do this
with the physical medium.

599
00:39:53,186 --> 00:39:57,703
You're gonna be there 100%
with your abilities, as well.

600
00:39:57,704 --> 00:40:03,604
You're gonna get rid of him, so
you're not gonna feel that anymore.

601
00:40:06,535 --> 00:40:10,703
- What about the old lady?
- She actually is here to try to help.

602
00:40:10,704 --> 00:40:15,998
I mean, it's good for her to be
here right now until he's gone.

603
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:20,002
She'll be taken care of, like, kind
of inadvertently through this process.

604
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:23,028
And then the last thing is
dealing with the PK manifestation,

605
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:27,212
that's, you know,
upstairs in your closet.

606
00:40:27,213 --> 00:40:30,836
What you want to do is a
little bit of counseling,

607
00:40:30,837 --> 00:40:33,269
just to work out those past issues.

608
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:37,048
So, you're taking it outside
of the house to a person...

609
00:40:37,049 --> 00:40:38,691
- Rather than in here.
- Right.

610
00:40:38,692 --> 00:40:41,768
And you're verbalizing
it out to that therapist.

611
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:44,039
Will it ever go away?

612
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,572
Um, no.

613
00:40:45,573 --> 00:40:51,114
I mean, it, very slowly over a very
long period of time, could dissipate.

614
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,526
So as long as you keep
it stunted, it's great.

615
00:40:54,527 --> 00:40:56,926
What about this guy John Shannon?

616
00:40:56,927 --> 00:41:02,747
Till this stuff gets resolved,
are they gonna be all right?

617
00:41:04,886 --> 00:41:08,671
Yes. You know your power over him.

618
00:41:08,672 --> 00:41:12,947
And so you just need to start
exerting that like nobody's business.

619
00:41:12,948 --> 00:41:15,743
And also tell your
children to do the same.

620
00:41:15,744 --> 00:41:18,846
- So you're empowering them.
- Mm hmm.

621
00:41:18,847 --> 00:41:21,682
Well, Cara, you're gonna
do what she tells you.

622
00:41:21,683 --> 00:41:25,043
- Definitely, yes.
- Okay.

623
00:41:27,823 --> 00:41:33,460
I truly believe the PK manifestation
poses a dangerous threat to Cara's family.

624
00:41:33,461 --> 00:41:36,581
If she follows the steps I
outlined, it will slowly dissolve,

625
00:41:36,582 --> 00:41:41,028
and she and her two kids can
live in their home in peace.
