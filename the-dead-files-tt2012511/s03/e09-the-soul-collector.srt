Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:05,289 --> 00:00:08,325
There's a male who's really maniacal.

3
00:00:08,326 --> 00:00:10,527
He likes walking up right behind 'em.

4
00:00:10,528 --> 00:00:13,062
I feel as though I'm being watched.

5
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:16,065
I looked around, and
there was no one there.

6
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:17,867
I want it to be over.

7
00:00:17,868 --> 00:00:21,588
I don't feel comfortable here.

8
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:23,706
Were their bodies ever found?

9
00:00:23,707 --> 00:00:24,604
This is bad.

10
00:00:24,605 --> 00:00:26,143
I'd like to have some answers.

11
00:00:26,144 --> 00:00:28,145
Do you know what happened?

12
00:00:28,146 --> 00:00:30,726
Everybody dies.

13
00:00:32,816 --> 00:00:35,197
They're being watched.

14
00:00:35,198 --> 00:00:38,221
My name is Amy Allan.

15
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:40,290
This thing likes death.

16
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,058
I see dead people.

17
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:43,707
This thing is, like, a monster.

18
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,595
I speak to dead people...

19
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:47,466
And he's pissed off now.

20
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:48,889
And they speak to me.

21
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,441
His head was cracked.

22
00:00:50,442 --> 00:00:53,336
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

23
00:00:53,337 --> 00:00:56,906
This guy was murdered.
I rely on my partner.

24
00:00:56,907 --> 00:00:58,316
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

25
00:00:58,317 --> 00:01:00,293
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

26
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:03,112
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

27
00:01:03,113 --> 00:01:06,283
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

28
00:01:06,284 --> 00:01:08,951
You saw her? It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:10,300
Why would you stay here?

30
00:01:10,301 --> 00:01:12,259
But Steve and I never speak.

31
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,391
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:14,392 --> 00:01:15,670
Until the very end.

33
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:17,537
Stop it.

34
00:01:17,538 --> 00:01:19,396
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

35
00:01:19,397 --> 00:01:21,904
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

36
00:01:21,905 --> 00:01:23,366
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:28,047
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

38
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:53,830
Amy and I work
independently of one another.

39
00:01:53,831 --> 00:01:55,832
I gather evidence, interview witnesses,

40
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,801
and sort through the
history of each location,

41
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:02,356
at the end, we come together
to reveal our findings.

42
00:02:02,357 --> 00:02:04,541
I'm headed to
Parkersburg, West Virginia.

43
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:09,746
It's a small town on the Ohio River,
about an hour north of Charleston.

44
00:02:09,747 --> 00:02:12,215
I received a call from
a woman named Tisha.

45
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:17,847
Her and her eight children are being
terrorized by something in their new home.

46
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:21,005
She can't afford to leave, but
she is scared to stay there.

47
00:02:21,006 --> 00:02:25,446
I'm hoping Amy and I can help her out.

48
00:02:36,374 --> 00:02:38,974
Looking at the photos and
artwork throughout the house,

49
00:02:38,975 --> 00:02:42,694
it's clear to me that
a family lives here.

50
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:45,708
So it's important that I take my
time to remove any personal evidence,

51
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:50,149
that could influence
Amy during her walk.

52
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:20,089
What's going on?

53
00:03:23,168 --> 00:03:27,548
I saw water and felt ice cold and wet.

54
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,329
Well, there was, like,
someone who has drowned.

55
...
...
...
gonna go, like, every window,

607
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:30,862
every doorway, everything
that could be an entrance.

608
00:40:30,863 --> 00:40:32,983
And you let it burn there.

609
00:40:32,984 --> 00:40:34,867
Why... why Sage, though?

610
00:40:34,868 --> 00:40:39,728
It is thought to be a
natural cleansing agent.

611
00:40:40,173 --> 00:40:43,194
To disperse residual energy.

612
00:40:43,195 --> 00:40:45,376
The other thing is in each room,

613
00:40:45,377 --> 00:40:48,574
you're gonna take salt, and just
filling up your palm with it,

614
00:40:48,575 --> 00:40:54,026
taking a little sprinkle, throwing
it in the four corners of each room.

615
00:40:54,027 --> 00:40:56,474
They're gonna all be attracted to this.

616
00:40:56,475 --> 00:41:02,375
Then what you're going to do is throw
it out the front door, and that's it.

617
00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:05,748
The dead people at this location
will be drawn to the salt.

618
00:41:05,749 --> 00:41:08,953
When Tisha throws it outside,
this will release them.

619
00:41:08,954 --> 00:41:12,357
There's a lot of people
here who want to leave.

620
00:41:12,358 --> 00:41:17,398
The air will be so much
better, so much lighter.

621
00:41:19,197 --> 00:41:22,212
I've always felt like there was
something here that needed my help.

622
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:26,833
And I didn't know how
to help them, so...

623
00:41:27,706 --> 00:41:30,231
But promise me you guys
are gonna do what she says.

624
00:41:30,232 --> 00:41:32,028
Absolutely.

625
00:41:32,029 --> 00:41:35,869
- Probably tomorrow.
- Good, good.

626
00:41:36,216 --> 00:41:39,751
There are several dead
people inhabiting this house.

627
00:41:39,752 --> 00:41:44,255
But I think only the man in the
long black coat presents any danger.

628
00:41:44,256 --> 00:41:48,205
And I believe as long as Tisha
and her family follow my advice,

629
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:51,686
everyone should remain safe.
