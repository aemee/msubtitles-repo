00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:08,069
Oh, yeah, this is creepy.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,139
We've heard things. We've been touched.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,188
He can get physical if he wants to.

5
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:16,244
My daughter talks about seeing things.

6
00:00:16,245 --> 00:00:19,108
It looked like a Grim Reaper.

7
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,482
The death was suspicious.

8
00:00:21,483 --> 00:00:24,723
He was killed instantly.

9
00:00:25,048 --> 00:00:26,941
So you feel that whatever's
here wants you out?

10
00:00:26,942 --> 00:00:28,986
Absolutely.

11
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:32,287
He wants to hurt people.

12
00:00:33,495 --> 00:00:36,033
They're being watched.

13
00:00:36,034 --> 00:00:38,941
My name is Amy Allan.

14
00:00:38,942 --> 00:00:41,192
This thing likes death.

15
00:00:41,193 --> 00:00:42,975
I see dead people.

16
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,543
This thing is, like, a monster.

17
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,613
I speak to dead people.

18
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:48,303
And he's pissed off now.

19
00:00:48,304 --> 00:00:49,812
And they speak to me.

20
00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:51,408
His head was cracked.

21
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:54,388
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

22
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:56,438
This guy was murdered.

23
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:57,857
I rely on my partner.

24
00:00:57,858 --> 00:00:59,261
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

25
00:00:59,262 --> 00:01:01,212
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

26
00:01:01,213 --> 00:01:03,930
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

27
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:07,023
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

28
00:01:07,024 --> 00:01:09,936
You saw her? It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,089
Why would you stay here?

30
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,213
But Steve and I never speak...

31
00:01:13,214 --> 00:01:15,197
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:15,198 --> 00:01:16,609
Until the very end.

33
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,383
Stop it.

34
00:01:18,384 --> 00:01:20,547
We uncover if it's safe for you to stay...

35
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:22,953
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

36
00:01:22,954 --> 00:01:24,284
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:28,965
I told you there were ghosts in this house.

38
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:55,828
Amy and I conduct our
investigations separately.

39
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:59,314
I interview witnesses and dig
into the history of the location.

40
00:01:59,315 --> 00:02:03,070
While Amy communicates with the dead.

41
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:07,556
At the end, we get together
to reveal our findings.

42
00:02:07,557 --> 00:02:13,457
I'm in Wichita, Kansas, on my way to a
property owned by a husband-and-wife team.

43
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:19,626
They run a beauty salon and an
auto shop on the same property.

44
00:02:19,627 --> 00:02:23,230
The husband Jeff says violent spirits
are destroying his business,

45
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:27,311
their family life, and their sanity.

46
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:42,357
Amy needs to be free from outside
influences during her walk.

47
00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:47,302
So it's important that I cover
or remove all photographs,

48
00:02:47,303 --> 00:02:51,203
artwork, and even religious icons.

49
00:02:52,294 --> 00:02:58,194
Once I'm done, the building will
be clear for tonight's walk.

50
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:29,409
Uh, well, I'm not open at all.

51
00:03:32,267 --> 00:03:38,167
I usually open to communicate with
the dead as I approach a location.

52
00:03:38,572 --> 00:03:44,472
But this area has such an overwhelming
amount of death surrounding it...

53
00:03:46,243 --> 00:03:51,583
That I decided to do my
opening inside the location.

54
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,159
This is some... some...

55
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,540
Some bad [Bleep] going on over in here.

56
00:04:08,003 --> 00:04:10,282
Not good. Not good at all.

57
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:13,943
Yeah, this is some bad stuff.

58
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:20,374
Bad ground. Always been bad.
Will always be bad.

59
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:24,755
Bad [Bleep] is always gonna happen here.

60
00:04:37,915 --> 00:04:40,041
Jeff, you sounded concerned on the phone.

61
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:41,453
Well, I am concerned.

62
00:04:41,454 --> 00:04:44,759
You know, really I'm fighting
to save two businesses here.

63
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,119
- My wife has the salon here in front.
- Okay.

64
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,303
And then I have my garage here at the back.

65
00:04:49,304 --> 00:04:51,036
Give me an idea what's going on.

66
00:04:51,037 --> 00:04:54,648
We've heard things. We've
been touched, pushed.

67
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:58,385
We've had things misplaced
in the salon and the shop.

68
00:04:58,386 --> 00:05:00,549
I'd like my kids to be able
to take over the business,

69
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,973
but right now I'm not even
comfortable having 'em in there.

70
00:05:02,974 --> 00:05:05,359
- How old are the kids?
- Fifteen and nine.

71
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,102
My daughter's actually experienced things,
and you know, as a father that concerns me,

72
00:05:09,103 --> 00:05:12,666
because I'm, you know, not sure if she can
handle that or understands what's going on.

73
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:14,734
How are you and your
wife handling all this?

74
00:05:14,735 --> 00:05:17,920
My wife would just as soon sell the
place, where I want to keep it.

75
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:21,306
And you know, this is something that
we built over the last seven years...

76
00:05:21,307 --> 00:05:23,646
And I'm not just willing
to walk away from it.

77
00:05:23,647 --> 00:05:26,838
Okay. What about yourself? Have you ever
seen anything or experienced anything?

78
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,702
I just finished working on some vehicles...

79
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,100
- Okay.
- And I looked up inside,

80
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:33,677
and I saw somebody standing there.

81
00:05:33,678 --> 00:05:35,781
Looked like an older gentleman, maybe.

82
00:05:35,782 --> 00:05:40,131
Um, I'm guessing him to be in his
mid to late 50s with a beard.

83
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,902
Alright, did you go inside to search?

84
00:05:41,903 --> 00:05:43,553
We did. All of us went inside.

85
00:05:43,554 --> 00:05:48,354
We found out that there
was nobody in there.

86
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,042
There's one kinda creepy dude.

87
00:05:56,043 --> 00:05:59,883
He's kinda like a greaser dude.

88
00:06:01,382 --> 00:06:03,750
And he likes his area.

89
00:06:03,751 --> 00:06:05,919
- What's that?
- Um...

90
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,669
The driveway, this whole thing...

91
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,864
This whole building...

92
00:06:11,865 --> 00:06:14,385
His territory.

93
00:06:16,498 --> 00:06:20,598
To me, he's, like, just a tough
guy, you know, just like...

94
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:25,819
"I'm... I'm tough. I'm bad.
I'm big. I'm bad".

95
00:06:27,074 --> 00:06:31,200
Like, would you say that he's dangerous?

96
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:33,061
Yes.

97
00:06:34,076 --> 00:06:37,556
But he's kinda [Bleep] up.

98
00:06:46,994 --> 00:06:49,196
So what's going on in here?

99
00:06:49,197 --> 00:06:51,665
There's a lot of things
that happen in here.

100
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,668
We started to notice that
tools would come up missing.

101
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:57,053
If you can't find 'em,
you can't work with 'em.

102
00:06:57,054 --> 00:06:59,751
- Anything else, Jeff?
- We've heard whispering.

103
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,320
I remember a time I was leaned over the
back of a car, and I'm in there working.

104
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:06,635
You know, you're turning wrenches, and
you're focused on what you're doing.

105
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:10,763
And then suddenly someone
whispers in my ear.

106
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:15,191
And I know that I'm alone in the garage
at that particular point, but I stand up.

107
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:18,612
There was nothing in here.

108
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:24,810
He likes to yell. Uh, he
likes to hear his voice.

109
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:28,171
He likes to hear himself.

110
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:32,706
He's able to manifest things.

111
00:07:32,707 --> 00:07:35,527
Like, it's weird.

112
00:07:36,876 --> 00:07:40,044
He likes to take things and make
'em disappear and reappear...

113
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:42,449
Reappear in weird places.

114
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,284
That's to irritate people.

115
00:07:44,285 --> 00:07:48,121
He doesn't want anybody in his space.
He hates them.

116
00:07:48,122 --> 00:07:49,923
- And what's...
- Living or dead.

117
00:07:49,924 --> 00:07:54,544
He just doesn't want anybody in his space.

118
00:07:55,096 --> 00:07:57,020
We were just opening up for the morning,

119
00:07:57,021 --> 00:08:02,541
and we heard footsteps run
right across the top of us.

120
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,341
We had gone up there,
couldn't find anything.

121
00:08:07,342 --> 00:08:10,940
And that's when we really started to worry,
because we expected to find something.

122
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:13,497
What the hell were you
thinking when that happened?

123
00:08:13,498 --> 00:08:16,975
It's disturbing. You're concerned.
You think somebody might be in here.

124
00:08:16,976 --> 00:08:20,857
But then a whole new fear rushes
over you that someone's not in here.

125
00:08:20,858 --> 00:08:24,112
So, Jeff, I'm assuming the guys you've got
working for you are, like, guy's guys,

126
00:08:24,113 --> 00:08:25,596
- you know, tough guys and...
- Yeah.

127
00:08:25,597 --> 00:08:27,396
They don't want to admit
that they're scared,

128
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,090
but you can see fear in somebody's eyes.

129
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,526
You can tell that they're not
just bothered by what happened,

130
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:33,612
but that it actually frightened them,

131
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:37,242
to the point that they don't even
want to talk about it sometimes.

132
00:08:37,243 --> 00:08:40,538
Do you think that anything that's going
on in the garage could be dangerous?

133
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:43,850
If it can, you know, move tools around in a
garage, if it can do things like that...

134
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:45,954
- Right.
- It could certainly try and hurt somebody.

135
00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:48,355
Right. Okay.

136
00:08:48,915 --> 00:08:53,835
Does this guy interact
with the living at all?

137
00:08:54,121 --> 00:08:58,353
Um, he can get physical if he wants to...

138
00:08:58,354 --> 00:09:01,002
Grabbing, pushing.

139
00:09:01,003 --> 00:09:03,142
- Okay.
- He likes to throw things.

140
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:04,757
Could he hurt anybody?

141
00:09:04,758 --> 00:09:08,778
I think he, uh, I think he could.

142
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:14,638
He's really good at the stuff
he's already learned how to do.

143
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,959
He knows how to affect his environment.

144
00:09:23,154 --> 00:09:25,385
Obviously this is a storage space.

145
00:09:25,386 --> 00:09:28,053
Um, did you use it? I mean,
it's kinda, like, wasted.

146
00:09:28,054 --> 00:09:29,948
No. My guys have reported the same thing.

147
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:32,381
None of 'em want to come back
here, you know, if they're gonna,

148
00:09:32,382 --> 00:09:35,529
put something in here for storage, they
either try and leave it for me to do,

149
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,654
or they just come, throw it in
here, and yank the door shut.

150
00:09:37,655 --> 00:09:39,840
I wish we could use it, I wish
we could do something with it,

151
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:41,708
but nobody likes to be out here.

152
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:43,786
- Why?
- You just feel a presence...

153
00:09:43,787 --> 00:09:45,572
A heaviness about the area.

154
00:09:45,573 --> 00:09:48,626
It's like you can't get a full
breath, you know, in your lungs.

155
00:09:48,627 --> 00:09:50,073
Like you can't breathe all the way.

156
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:51,526
Like you're in high altitude or something?

157
00:09:51,527 --> 00:09:54,647
Right, just like that.

158
00:09:58,511 --> 00:10:01,871
Oh, yeah, this is creepy.

159
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,956
What is?

160
00:10:04,957 --> 00:10:08,377
The thing that's in here.

161
00:10:10,498 --> 00:10:13,699
Making me feel uncomfortable and scared.

162
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,094
Like, I felt scared in my stomach.

163
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:19,435
What thing?

164
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,090
Death.

165
00:10:37,301 --> 00:10:39,737
This is creepy.

166
00:10:39,738 --> 00:10:41,898
What is?

167
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,152
Um, it looked like...

168
00:10:47,153 --> 00:10:49,899
Like a Grim Reaper.

169
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,957
But I think it's, you know, just
a regular dead person because,

170
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,755
I've seen death, and it doesn't...
doesn't look anything like that.

171
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,172
We all associate certain images with death.

172
00:10:59,173 --> 00:11:02,178
And we take those images
with us when we die.

173
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:06,892
It had, like, the whole thing, like,
skeleton face and the whole...

174
00:11:06,893 --> 00:11:09,804
Cloak and the sickle.

175
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:13,858
This dead man's projection is childish,
but it is still creeping me out.

176
00:11:13,859 --> 00:11:16,801
Which is exactly what he wants to do.

177
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:21,272
Now I'm picking up on his
death state and feeling, um,

178
00:11:21,273 --> 00:11:23,637
everything that he went through physically.

179
00:11:23,638 --> 00:11:26,853
It's, like, really hurting my head.

180
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:31,277
- I just feel very, very sick.
- You gonna be all right?

181
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:33,808
I'm out of it. Like, my equilibrium's off.

182
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:36,449
Uh, disoriented.

183
00:11:37,606 --> 00:11:40,726
It [Bleep] hurts, man.

184
00:11:47,392 --> 00:11:51,015
So, Emily, I was talking to your
husband Jeff and he basically said,

185
00:11:51,016 --> 00:11:53,460
you were ready to put the "for sale"
sign on this place and get outta here.

186
00:11:53,461 --> 00:11:54,627
What's going on?

187
00:11:54,628 --> 00:11:59,202
From the first time we unlocked the door
here, it's never felt like it's been ours.

188
00:11:59,203 --> 00:12:02,169
- Why do you say that?
- Um, stuff moves.

189
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,341
People get pushed.

190
00:12:04,342 --> 00:12:07,154
You hear people whispering in your ears.

191
00:12:07,155 --> 00:12:10,169
Doing hair there was a container
sitting on my cabinet,

192
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,852
it was in the middle of the station it
flipped in the air, and landed on its side.

193
00:12:13,853 --> 00:12:16,920
- What was in the can? Was it heavy?
- It was heavy, it was like a pomade.

194
00:12:16,921 --> 00:12:18,906
It was bad. It was scary.

195
00:12:18,907 --> 00:12:22,697
He never came back and got his hair cut.
And he was a regular for years.

196
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:25,104
Okay, so you're losing business
because of what's going on.

197
00:12:25,105 --> 00:12:27,064
Absolutely. One time I said...

198
00:12:27,065 --> 00:12:30,303
"Show me you're here, do something so that
I know you're here, and I'm not crazy".

199
00:12:30,304 --> 00:12:33,207
And I turned to shut the door behind
me, and I saw someone standing

200
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,810
right in the entryway between the
kitchen and the living room.

201
00:12:35,811 --> 00:12:38,402
- Who'd you see?
- I saw a man standing there.

202
00:12:38,403 --> 00:12:40,410
With a shirt and jeans.

203
00:12:40,411 --> 00:12:42,447
He had a goatee and gray hair.

204
00:12:42,448 --> 00:12:44,907
All right, so do you feel that
whatever's here wants you out?

205
00:12:44,908 --> 00:12:47,188
Absolutely.

206
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:01,690
The dead man inside the garage is so sick,

207
00:13:01,691 --> 00:13:05,375
that I'm experiencing exactly what
he went through when he died.

208
00:13:05,376 --> 00:13:09,413
The pain is so intense
that I have to leave.

209
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:14,394
There's a lot of stuff
coming in from outside.

210
00:13:15,613 --> 00:13:20,173
I'm, like, seeing this woman who's alive.

211
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:25,231
But the dead are just, like, following her.

212
00:13:25,232 --> 00:13:27,318
And then they're inside.

213
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:29,052
Why are they following her?

214
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:32,713
Uh, because she has abilities.

215
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:41,565
Do you have any idea if this Reaper
guy does follow her in here?

216
00:13:41,566 --> 00:13:43,426
Yes.

217
00:13:46,611 --> 00:13:48,511
Can he do anything to people here?

218
00:13:48,512 --> 00:13:52,410
Cause headaches and breathing issues...

219
00:13:52,411 --> 00:13:56,551
And feeling like you're gonna vomit.

220
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,522
Okay, so what's going on here?

221
00:14:05,523 --> 00:14:07,914
My daughter talks about seeing things.

222
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:11,983
She even drew a picture of, like,
a black figure with red eyes.

223
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,038
And she said that's something she saw here.

224
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,908
- Where's the picture?
- I threw it away immediately.

225
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:19,246
- I didn't want to think about it again.
- Now what did she say it was?

226
00:14:19,247 --> 00:14:22,814
It had no form, but you could tell it had
arms and legs, and it was all black.

227
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:24,116
How'd you react to it?

228
00:14:24,117 --> 00:14:27,703
It made my heart stop, because I don't
want to be putting her in danger.

229
00:14:27,704 --> 00:14:29,180
Emily, your daughter's 9?

230
00:14:29,181 --> 00:14:32,391
Yes. I want to preserve her innocence.

231
00:14:32,392 --> 00:14:34,668
I don't want her to be scared.

232
00:14:34,669 --> 00:14:36,589
Okay.

233
00:14:39,468 --> 00:14:43,131
The dead guy who showed himself
to me as the Grim Reaper...

234
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,679
Throughout his life he
seems to have some money.

235
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,408
Does he try to show himself to the living?

236
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:53,480
Well, he wants to, because
he has his disguises.

237
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:56,346
He likes the Grim Reaper the best.

238
00:14:56,347 --> 00:14:59,385
So would people see him as
the Grim Reaper in here?

239
00:14:59,386 --> 00:15:02,320
I would think that he would
come off more like...

240
00:15:02,321 --> 00:15:07,295
Like just, like, a black
mass or something like that.

241
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:10,118
And he wants to...

242
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:14,019
Make other people hurt themselves.

243
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,771
Daniel, I was talking to Jeff,

244
00:15:22,772 --> 00:15:25,788
and he mentioned that you
do work for him on and off.

245
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:28,511
He said you might have had
experiences here yourself.

246
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:30,797
Yeah, something did happen one night.

247
00:15:30,798 --> 00:15:33,052
Me and Jeff were working with
a battery that overheated.

248
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:34,873
We went and set it down
and got another one.

249
00:15:34,874 --> 00:15:39,621
A couple minutes later I went back to
the kitchen to get something to drink,

250
00:15:39,622 --> 00:15:44,698
opened the freezer up, and the
battery was sitting in the freezer.

251
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,833
So where'd you lay the battery down first?

252
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:51,037
Laid the battery down on the counter
across from the refrigerator.

253
00:15:51,038 --> 00:15:52,706
Jeff was with me the whole time.

254
00:15:52,707 --> 00:15:54,307
And nobody else was in the house?

255
00:15:54,308 --> 00:15:56,743
Nobody else was there at that time.

256
00:15:56,744 --> 00:16:01,348
When that happened to me, I was
more cautious about working here.

257
00:16:01,349 --> 00:16:04,450
- You don't look like you scare easy.
- I don't scare easy.

258
00:16:04,451 --> 00:16:06,333
I spent nine years in the Marine corps.

259
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:09,778
But stuff that you can't
explain tends to, you know,

260
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:15,679
scare you a little bit to where you're
thinking, "what's going on here?"

261
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,436
The greaser dude, he likes his area.

262
00:16:23,437 --> 00:16:25,849
The entities here are very territorial.

263
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:31,750
As soon as I walk to the garage, I'm
back in the greaser guy's space.

264
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:36,319
He gets pissed, you know,
if people are in his area.

265
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,685
So he will try to make them leave.

266
00:16:38,686 --> 00:16:40,996
Do you know how?

267
00:16:40,997 --> 00:16:46,897
Things will be moved, like, taken
from one place and put in another.

268
00:16:48,255 --> 00:16:51,116
I think this guy is
actually Apporting [Bleep].

269
00:16:51,117 --> 00:16:53,436
Apporting is the ability
to make things disappear,

270
00:16:53,437 --> 00:16:55,468
and reappear in different locations.

271
00:16:55,469 --> 00:17:00,929
Entities that have mastered
this can be very dangerous.

272
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:09,154
He's, like, really kind of a sociopath.

273
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:12,206
Like, he doesn't have any...

274
00:17:12,207 --> 00:17:15,927
Feelings or anything like that.

275
00:17:19,218 --> 00:17:21,666
I feel like...

276
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,999
Him, like, grabbing, like, my face.

277
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,400
You know, like, he would do that...
You know, like...

278
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,731
I'm headed over to meet
with a woman named Cheryl.

279
00:17:39,732 --> 00:17:42,800
She's the former owner of the property.

280
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:47,180
She tells me her time on the
property ended in tragedy.

281
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:51,921
I've gotta find out what this is all about.

282
00:17:59,017 --> 00:18:02,519
Cheryl, I got called in to
investigate your old home.

283
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,156
- How long did you live there?
- About five years.

284
00:18:05,157 --> 00:18:08,392
What did you use the garage for?
Was it always a garage?

285
00:18:08,393 --> 00:18:12,827
We did a lot of hangouts
with friends in there.

286
00:18:12,828 --> 00:18:18,093
People came by every day, and
it was like they lived there.

287
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:20,071
Looks like you had a good
time, a lot of bikers.

288
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:22,691
A lot of bikers.

289
00:18:22,692 --> 00:18:25,463
Uh, I gotta ask an unusual question.

290
00:18:25,464 --> 00:18:27,030
The people that are living
there now are claiming

291
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:29,581
there's a lot of paranormal
activity going on.

292
00:18:29,582 --> 00:18:32,179
When you lived there, did you ever
experience anything like that?

293
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:36,711
Nothing happened paranormally, but we lost
three of our dear friends within a year.

294
00:18:36,712 --> 00:18:39,532
- Really?
- Right.

295
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,040
This is Kevin. He's in the middle.

296
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:47,738
How'd you lose Kevin?

297
00:18:47,739 --> 00:18:52,570
Kevin was hit by a car on his motorcycle,
and he was killed instantly.

298
00:18:52,571 --> 00:18:54,373
And then we lost Tony.

299
00:18:54,374 --> 00:18:56,875
And he practically lived there.

300
00:18:56,876 --> 00:18:59,744
He had a stroke, and he died.

301
00:18:59,745 --> 00:19:01,746
He looks like a young guy, though.
How old was he?

302
00:19:01,747 --> 00:19:05,347
Oh, he was in his late 50s.

303
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,487
And then we had Mark, and he passed
away, and he was a dear friend.

304
00:19:09,488 --> 00:19:14,734
He had previously lived in the basement
of that house back 20 years ago.

305
00:19:14,735 --> 00:19:15,992
And what did he die of?

306
00:19:15,993 --> 00:19:19,692
He went to bed and didn't wake up.

307
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:21,233
I don't know what happened to him.

308
00:19:21,234 --> 00:19:26,771
I mean, he went from driving a brand-new
car to just living month to month.

309
00:19:26,772 --> 00:19:28,830
He had some problems and some issues.

310
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:34,731
He lived in an apartment complex that had
a lot of people that did drugs in it.

311
00:19:34,766 --> 00:19:39,129
Whatever he was doing, he just
looked worse every time I saw him.

312
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,132
Were you surprised when
they found him dead?

313
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:43,933
No.

314
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:52,463
The greaser dude, he's tall.

315
00:19:52,464 --> 00:19:56,759
He's wearing a black,
like, '50s biker jacket.

316
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,260
He killed himself, and he was intoxicated.

317
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,959
He was mad when I walked away.

318
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,469
As soon as I asked the
greaser guy about his death,

319
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:11,634
he gets very angry and wants
nothing to do with me.

320
00:20:11,635 --> 00:20:15,595
He's not gonna talk to me again.

321
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,918
Cheryl had some pretty tragic stories about

322
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,707
the people that used to
hang out at her house.

323
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,833
But no deaths actually happened there.

324
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:33,734
So I'm at the Genealogical Society seeing
what I can dig up in the archives.

325
00:20:34,752 --> 00:20:37,150
Turns out in 1977...

326
00:20:37,151 --> 00:20:39,121
A former owner named Helen Hillman,

327
00:20:39,122 --> 00:20:44,931
died on the property when she
fell down a flight of stairs.

328
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:47,473
I've asked a local reporter
to look into the accidental

329
00:20:47,474 --> 00:20:50,602
death of a woman who lived on
Jeff and Emily's property.

330
00:20:50,603 --> 00:20:52,957
I'm heading over to the cemetery
where the woman is buried,

331
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:57,038
to find out the rest of the story.

332
00:21:04,238 --> 00:21:08,118
Well, this is actually where
Helen Hillman is buried.

333
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:11,153
She was married when she was 19 in 1917.

334
00:21:11,154 --> 00:21:13,895
That's a picture of her and
William on their wedding day.

335
00:21:13,896 --> 00:21:17,388
Then they moved from Arkansas to
right outside of Wichita, Kansas,

336
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:19,247
on the property that you're investigating.

337
00:21:19,248 --> 00:21:20,497
And when did they move in?

338
00:21:20,498 --> 00:21:22,514
1947, I believe.

339
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:25,420
Now what were you able to find out
about the circumstances of her death?

340
00:21:25,421 --> 00:21:30,544
Well, according to her death certificate,
it said "massive head injury".

341
00:21:30,545 --> 00:21:34,261
Even though she was 79, according to her
descendants, she was in good health.

342
00:21:34,262 --> 00:21:36,025
They said that she had a zest for life.

343
00:21:36,026 --> 00:21:38,418
She was active. She lived independently.

344
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:40,146
All right, so it was odd the way she died.

345
00:21:40,147 --> 00:21:41,906
Yes, it was very odd.

346
00:21:41,907 --> 00:21:44,458
She had lived in that house for so long,

347
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:47,306
and the distance between
the stairs and the floor,

348
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,958
wouldn't be enough to
kill someone, typically.

349
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:52,810
- It says "massive head injuries".
- Mm hmm.

350
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,046
I don't know if that fall can
cause injuries like that.

351
00:21:55,047 --> 00:22:00,447
Yes, and that's why I think
the death is suspicious.

352
00:22:02,715 --> 00:22:05,895
There's another person.

353
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:08,857
She's more evolved.

354
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,240
She's not in her death state anymore.

355
00:22:14,241 --> 00:22:17,852
- She got out of that pretty quickly.
- Okay.

356
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:21,513
I think she broke her neck...

357
00:22:22,393 --> 00:22:25,273
Early of mid '70s.

358
00:22:27,686 --> 00:22:31,046
She was dead, like, fast.

359
00:22:49,991 --> 00:22:51,613
She's not in her death state anymore.

360
00:22:51,614 --> 00:22:55,620
- She got out of that pretty quickly.
- Okay.

361
00:22:55,621 --> 00:22:57,580
Early of mid '70s...

362
00:22:57,581 --> 00:23:00,701
That's when she died.

363
00:23:01,586 --> 00:23:04,210
She was dead, like, fast.

364
00:23:04,211 --> 00:23:06,851
Broke her neck.

365
00:23:09,705 --> 00:23:13,125
Oh, God, it [Bleep] hurts.

366
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:24,809
This woman is making me extremely sad.

367
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,626
She's in so much physical
and emotional pain.

368
00:23:27,627 --> 00:23:30,194
That she seems lost and confused.

369
00:23:30,195 --> 00:23:32,656
And most of all scared.

370
00:23:32,657 --> 00:23:37,577
She kind of, uh, runs
away from living people.

371
00:23:39,991 --> 00:23:43,951
Sometimes she's reliving her life.

372
00:23:44,797 --> 00:23:48,517
Ah, now I'm getting her pain.

373
00:24:01,767 --> 00:24:03,472
I'm on my way to meet with a historian,

374
00:24:03,473 --> 00:24:05,789
who helped me out the last
time I was in Wichita.

375
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,734
He dug deep into the property's history,

376
00:24:07,735 --> 00:24:13,555
and he told me he uncovered some
pretty unusual information.

377
00:24:19,445 --> 00:24:21,400
So, Anthony, what were you
able to find out about the

378
00:24:21,401 --> 00:24:23,886
early history of the
property I'm investigating?

379
00:24:23,887 --> 00:24:26,134
The interesting thing about
this piece of property,

380
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:28,772
is the number of times
that it's changed hands.

381
00:24:28,773 --> 00:24:33,911
Over 30 people have owned it since
it was first purchased up until now.

382
00:24:33,912 --> 00:24:37,118
Out of all these people that tend
to come and go on this property,

383
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:39,466
did anybody stand out?

384
00:24:39,467 --> 00:24:43,239
Yeah, a Dr. Alfred Ray was one of the guys,

385
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,300
that seemed to be very, very interesting.

386
00:24:46,301 --> 00:24:49,532
He was a physician who came
to this part of the country.

387
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:51,858
He brought his whole family with him,

388
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:55,070
and he purchased this property,
from the outside looking in,

389
00:24:55,071 --> 00:24:58,234
we assume that he was going to
be setting up his family there.

390
00:24:58,235 --> 00:24:59,994
And living on it for generations.

391
00:24:59,995 --> 00:25:02,742
And yet within less than six months,

392
00:25:02,743 --> 00:25:08,643
he's already sold the property and has
moved on with his whole family with him.

393
00:25:08,649 --> 00:25:12,284
The reason why Dr. Ray stands out so much,

394
00:25:12,285 --> 00:25:15,045
is that he was a man with business savvy.

395
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:18,953
And yet he comes to this one
particular piece of property.

396
00:25:18,954 --> 00:25:20,648
He's there for six months.

397
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:23,813
And then he left it without
even developing it.

398
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:26,454
That's strange.

399
00:25:32,737 --> 00:25:36,049
Bad [Bleep] is always gonna happen here.

400
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:41,950
It's like, oh, kinda bad, worse,
worse, really, really bad...

401
00:25:42,244 --> 00:25:44,944
[Bleep] Terrible.

402
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:51,671
So basically it's... it's anybody
that lives here or on this land is...

403
00:25:51,672 --> 00:25:53,562
Are they gonna have problems because of it?

404
00:25:53,563 --> 00:25:55,783
Oh, yeah.

405
00:25:58,315 --> 00:26:03,034
You know, they'll have,
uh, struggle and, uh...

406
00:26:03,035 --> 00:26:05,834
You know, negative things will happen.

407
00:26:05,835 --> 00:26:09,553
So I think it's just automatically gonna...

408
00:26:09,554 --> 00:26:11,354
Draw negativity.

409
00:26:11,355 --> 00:26:14,658
And, like, I think it makes people angry.

410
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:18,799
It makes people act in bizarre ways.

411
00:26:27,472 --> 00:26:29,857
During my walk I saw a strange scene,

412
00:26:29,858 --> 00:26:33,443
where a living person was leading
a trail of dead into the house.

413
00:26:33,444 --> 00:26:37,481
I'm meeting with a sketch artist
to describe what I encountered.

414
00:26:37,482 --> 00:26:42,522
I saw this woman at the
door about to open it.

415
00:26:43,837 --> 00:26:45,979
Behind her...

416
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,280
Is this really tall man.

417
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:54,309
And he is wearing, like, a black cloak.

418
00:26:55,771 --> 00:26:59,637
And then slightly to his right is...

419
00:26:59,638 --> 00:27:05,538
The back of a man who is wearing a
cowboy hat, jeans, and cowboy boots.

420
00:27:10,841 --> 00:27:14,321
Amy, is this what you saw?

421
00:27:15,987 --> 00:27:17,847
Yes.

422
00:27:37,163 --> 00:27:39,687
Now that Amy and I have
finished our investigations.

423
00:27:39,688 --> 00:27:45,140
It's time to sit down with Jeff and his
wife Emily to reveal what we've uncovered.

424
00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:49,523
This is Emily and Jeff. They're married
and actually own this property.

425
00:27:49,524 --> 00:27:51,929
Jeff actually runs the garage here.

426
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,991
Emily runs the salon up front.

427
00:27:53,992 --> 00:27:56,993
They've had a lot of experiences here.
It's affecting work.

428
00:27:56,994 --> 00:27:59,655
It's affecting business. And it's
affecting their relationship.

429
00:27:59,656 --> 00:28:03,280
They want to make sure it's okay for them
to stay here and if it's safe for the kids.

430
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:09,161
That being said, we'll hear a
little bit about Amy's walk.

431
00:28:12,246 --> 00:28:17,612
When I started my walk, I came into
contact with this creepy male.

432
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:21,316
He is a really tall guy.
He had a leather jacket.

433
00:28:21,317 --> 00:28:23,818
His hair is greased back.

434
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:26,815
He hates anybody in his space.

435
00:28:26,816 --> 00:28:29,825
Because he considers the
driveway, that front area,

436
00:28:29,826 --> 00:28:33,127
and this entire garage and
the back of it his space.

437
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:36,278
One night I remember this
guy looking from the back,

438
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:39,102
and as I started to go inside...

439
00:28:39,103 --> 00:28:42,823
They were gone just like that.

440
00:28:42,904 --> 00:28:45,313
When he gets upset, he likes to yell.

441
00:28:45,314 --> 00:28:48,080
He likes to throw things.

442
00:28:48,081 --> 00:28:50,849
He also does a thing called Apporting.

443
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,234
What the hell is Apporting?

444
00:28:52,235 --> 00:28:56,194
It's a phenomena where
an object can disappear,

445
00:28:56,195 --> 00:28:58,336
from one place and reappear in another.

446
00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:01,742
Seemingly out of thin air.

447
00:29:01,743 --> 00:29:05,152
Why don't you tell Amy about
some of your experiences here.

448
00:29:05,153 --> 00:29:07,676
We definitely get things
moving here all the time.

449
00:29:07,677 --> 00:29:11,818
And whatever's doing this is
moving at a great distance.

450
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:14,203
Well, I mean, he definitely has a mission.

451
00:29:14,204 --> 00:29:18,793
And everything he does
is to get you to leave.

452
00:29:18,794 --> 00:29:21,410
He did try to physically attack me.

453
00:29:21,411 --> 00:29:27,311
So I feel like he wants to hurt
the living if he hasn't already.

454
00:29:29,055 --> 00:29:31,968
We started to have a really good dialogue,

455
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:36,700
but what ended up happening was I
felt like he had killed himself.

456
00:29:36,701 --> 00:29:38,439
And I said that...

457
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,601
And he was so,

458
00:29:40,602 --> 00:29:44,382
irate that he just stormed off.

459
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,082
I spoke to the previous
owners of the property.

460
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:50,586
And they told me this garage
was basically a party house.

461
00:29:50,587 --> 00:29:54,607
So all the bikers would come here.

462
00:29:54,651 --> 00:29:57,459
There was a bar in here.
There was a pool table.

463
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,187
Right after they sold the property,

464
00:29:59,188 --> 00:30:02,608
three of the guys that hung out
here on a continuous basis...

465
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:04,710
Died within a year.

466
00:30:04,711 --> 00:30:08,073
One died in an accident, got
killed on his motorcycle.

467
00:30:08,074 --> 00:30:10,570
The other guy died of a stroke.

468
00:30:10,571 --> 00:30:15,551
And then the third guy
is this guy right here.

469
00:30:16,484 --> 00:30:18,814
Now his name was Mark.

470
00:30:18,815 --> 00:30:21,210
A lot of the friends thought
he was on a downward spiral,

471
00:30:21,211 --> 00:30:25,587
and that he was in a sense killing
himself by what he was doing to himself.

472
00:30:25,588 --> 00:30:30,628
He actually lived in the
basement of your salon.

473
00:30:31,655 --> 00:30:34,207
Does this guy look familiar at all?

474
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:38,275
Yeah, I remember distinctly seeing this.

475
00:30:38,276 --> 00:30:43,470
The look in his eyes, him looking
back at me was very similar.

476
00:30:43,471 --> 00:30:45,689
Now, Emily, you saw an apparition.

477
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:49,389
Yes, between the kitchen
and the living room.

478
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,479
Does this look familiar at all?

479
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,377
Oh, yes, absolutely.

480
00:30:53,378 --> 00:30:57,158
I'm scared with my kids
or my husband out here.

481
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:00,798
Would he hurt me or somebody out here,
or is he just trying to scare us?

482
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,219
No, he wants to hurt you.

483
00:31:04,374 --> 00:31:06,585
He wants you out.

484
00:31:06,586 --> 00:31:09,827
For a dead person to learn how to...

485
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:13,008
Throw objects, apport...

486
00:31:13,178 --> 00:31:18,278
If you put those together,
you've got a problem.

487
00:31:23,127 --> 00:31:25,647
So what else did you see on your walk?

488
00:31:25,648 --> 00:31:29,848
I saw a woman up in the attic area.

489
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:34,373
She was, like, re-experiencing her life,
so sometimes she's, like, back in it.

490
00:31:34,374 --> 00:31:38,002
But when she's here, she's very frightened.

491
00:31:38,003 --> 00:31:40,273
She doesn't know where she
is or what's going on.

492
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:42,140
And she's terrified of the living.

493
00:31:42,141 --> 00:31:45,266
- Now you said the attic?
- Yeah, up those stairs.

494
00:31:45,267 --> 00:31:50,797
We opened the attic door at one point, and
it was almost like we startled someone.

495
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:55,152
And whatever it was ran
across to the corner.

496
00:31:55,153 --> 00:31:57,686
And we fully expected to find someone.

497
00:31:57,687 --> 00:32:01,739
So we ascended the ladder,
looking for something up there.

498
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,608
There was... there was
never anything there.

499
00:32:03,609 --> 00:32:06,878
She's just really, really terrified.

500
00:32:06,879 --> 00:32:11,619
Her death was so fast
and extremely painful.

501
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:14,350
She didn't really process it.

502
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:17,334
It was a very sharp...

503
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,880
Pain in the neck.

504
00:32:19,881 --> 00:32:24,137
And I did get that she died in the '70s.

505
00:32:24,138 --> 00:32:26,068
There's a woman, Helen Hillman,

506
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:31,533
who lived in the house that your
salon is in from 1947 to 1977.

507
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:34,073
1977 is when she died.

508
00:32:34,074 --> 00:32:38,634
She fell down the steps into the basement.

509
00:32:39,203 --> 00:32:41,666
- That's where they found her.
- Wow.

510
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:45,376
She died of massive head injuries.

511
00:32:45,377 --> 00:32:48,917
That's her and her husband.

512
00:32:53,815 --> 00:32:58,075
That's really sad, really, really sad.

513
00:33:00,094 --> 00:33:02,095
So what else did you get on the walk?

514
00:33:02,096 --> 00:33:06,532
I saw something really strange
in the old garage area.

515
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:11,093
What I saw was your typical Grim Reaper...

516
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,552
The skeleton face, the sickle,
the cloak, the whole thing.

517
00:33:16,553 --> 00:33:19,244
And that's really odd,
because I've seen death,

518
00:33:19,245 --> 00:33:21,820
before and death actually
does not look like that.

519
00:33:21,821 --> 00:33:26,773
So as I'm looking deeper, I can feel
and tell that this is a dead person.

520
00:33:26,774 --> 00:33:28,992
That it's a dead male.

521
00:33:28,993 --> 00:33:32,449
That he hid in life a lot,

522
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:35,473
and now he's hiding again in death.

523
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:38,241
When I went in there, I, um...

524
00:33:38,242 --> 00:33:41,075
Felt like I had been beaten up.

525
00:33:41,076 --> 00:33:44,762
I couldn't breathe. My head felt
like it was going to explode.

526
00:33:44,763 --> 00:33:47,050
Tell her the feeling you guys
get when you go back there.

527
00:33:47,051 --> 00:33:50,081
The back side of the property,
especially by that old garage...

528
00:33:50,082 --> 00:33:52,690
We feel this... this pressure.

529
00:33:52,691 --> 00:33:56,506
And I would say it's like the air's
kinda sucked out of the room.

530
00:33:56,507 --> 00:34:02,407
It would be like being in high altitude,
really, but there's no explanation for it.

531
00:34:02,611 --> 00:34:07,753
Basically, he wants to cause
pain and to hurt people.

532
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,792
He's trying to stop you from breathing?

533
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:11,653
Yes.

534
00:34:12,955 --> 00:34:16,035
The other thing that I saw was...

535
00:34:16,036 --> 00:34:19,756
A sensitive who... who's here.

536
00:34:20,057 --> 00:34:23,548
And she knowingly or unknowingly...

537
00:34:23,549 --> 00:34:27,404
Lets the dead on the property
into the main house.

538
00:34:27,405 --> 00:34:28,923
They just kind of follow her.

539
00:34:28,924 --> 00:34:32,596
And this includes the Grim Reaper guy.

540
00:34:32,597 --> 00:34:35,415
Remember the dark mist with your daughter?

541
00:34:35,416 --> 00:34:37,275
Tell Amy about that.

542
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:41,443
She drew a figure that
she saw in the basement.

543
00:34:41,444 --> 00:34:46,514
It was a full figure like a human,
but with red eyes and all black.

544
00:34:46,515 --> 00:34:48,883
And she drew a picture of that.
I said, "oh, what's this?"

545
00:34:48,884 --> 00:34:52,912
She said, "oh, mom, that's
the man in the basement".

546
00:34:52,913 --> 00:34:57,328
Okay, I did do a sketch of what I saw.

547
00:34:57,329 --> 00:35:03,229
As far as this individual leading
several dead people into the house.

548
00:35:10,049 --> 00:35:11,849
Oh.

549
00:35:15,594 --> 00:35:17,994
Is that me?

550
00:35:37,373 --> 00:35:40,833
I did do a sketch of what I saw.

551
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:46,547
As far as this individual leading
several dead people into the house.

552
00:35:46,548 --> 00:35:48,468
Okay.

553
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:57,841
Oh.

554
00:36:07,224 --> 00:36:09,624
Is that me?

555
00:36:19,352 --> 00:36:22,859
When was the first time
you had an experience?

556
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,440
When I was 2.

557
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:31,120
What kind of experiences have you had?

558
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:34,706
A lot.

559
00:36:35,828 --> 00:36:38,681
I noticed doing hair that I
can't even touch some people,

560
00:36:38,682 --> 00:36:44,582
or I feel, like, their pain, and
I start crying for no reason.

561
00:36:51,762 --> 00:36:56,682
Is there a reason why
you're running from it?

562
00:37:00,307 --> 00:37:04,267
It's something that if you run...

563
00:37:04,277 --> 00:37:07,380
Or try to run from it...

564
00:37:07,381 --> 00:37:12,106
They're gonna follow you. And it's
hereditary, it runs in families.

565
00:37:12,107 --> 00:37:15,467
I see it in my daughter.

566
00:37:19,245 --> 00:37:22,742
Prior owners never felt this or anything.

567
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:27,717
Nobody ever... is it because possibly
she's a sensitive that this is happening?

568
00:37:27,718 --> 00:37:32,420
If they see somebody who can talk
to them who's ignoring them...

569
00:37:32,421 --> 00:37:35,781
They get a little feisty.

570
00:37:41,479 --> 00:37:44,641
The last thing that I got is...

571
00:37:44,642 --> 00:37:47,162
Really crappy.

572
00:37:47,901 --> 00:37:51,775
This land draws negativity to it.

573
00:37:51,776 --> 00:37:54,700
And a lot of bad things have happened here.

574
00:37:54,701 --> 00:37:57,159
When people are here, they struggle.

575
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,707
They go broke.

576
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:01,625
They... there's fires. There's robberies.

577
00:38:01,626 --> 00:38:06,950
You know, like, it's never okay in...
in this, going way back, area.

578
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,337
Hmm, it's interesting you say
that, though, because...

579
00:38:10,338 --> 00:38:14,476
What we're sitting on was
part of a 160-acre farm.

580
00:38:14,477 --> 00:38:20,377
And it got turned over 30 times
in 80 years, which is unheard of.

581
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,753
There's surrounding farms...

582
00:38:23,754 --> 00:38:27,651
No problems. They didn't...
families for generations.

583
00:38:27,652 --> 00:38:31,192
It makes total sense to me.

584
00:38:33,864 --> 00:38:36,662
Well, you've seen the results
of the investigation,

585
00:38:36,663 --> 00:38:38,652
learned about the dark
history of this property.

586
00:38:38,653 --> 00:38:42,339
You've seen and heard who
Amy's encountered here.

587
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,809
But the most important question
is, is it gonna be safe,

588
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:47,159
for you guys, your employees, customers...

589
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,527
Most importantly your family?

590
00:38:49,528 --> 00:38:54,028
For that I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

591
00:38:56,359 --> 00:39:00,514
There's a few things that are
going to have to be done.

592
00:39:00,515 --> 00:39:03,827
The first thing is dealing with the land.

593
00:39:03,828 --> 00:39:09,288
The house is actually in a
good position on the land.

594
00:39:10,121 --> 00:39:15,651
But once you get to the back deck, it
begins to get progressively worse.

595
00:39:15,652 --> 00:39:20,041
But it gets really dark when
you hit the old garage.

596
00:39:20,042 --> 00:39:25,622
That's where a line literally
needs to be drawn weekly.

597
00:39:25,656 --> 00:39:29,188
And all you have to do is
draw a line with salt.

598
00:39:29,189 --> 00:39:33,889
And that'll help with the whole
contamination factor of the land here.

599
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:39,790
The other thing that needs to be done is
to take care of the girl in the attic.

600
00:39:40,062 --> 00:39:44,180
This is something that you
innately have the ability to do.

601
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:45,948
Get some Sage and some salt.

602
00:39:45,949 --> 00:39:49,092
Go ahead and Sage the building
inside and out, including the attic.

603
00:39:49,093 --> 00:39:51,254
Then taking the salt...

604
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:56,175
And drawing a line all
along the walls inside.

605
00:39:56,299 --> 00:39:58,493
Tossing it around the attic,

606
00:39:58,494 --> 00:40:03,938
and taking the salt all around the
outside of the building as well.

607
00:40:03,939 --> 00:40:06,494
What about the Grim Reaper
and the greaser guy?

608
00:40:06,495 --> 00:40:11,893
So the greaser guy and the Grim
Reaper are actually the same person.

609
00:40:11,894 --> 00:40:16,634
And at some point after
death, he fractured.

610
00:40:18,118 --> 00:40:21,719
Occasionally, I'll meet a dead person...

611
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,020
That forms an attachment.

612
00:40:26,135 --> 00:40:27,849
So...

613
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:31,163
I'm going to go ahead and
take him home with me.

614
00:40:31,164 --> 00:40:33,470
- What the hell are you talking about?
- He's attached to me anyway,

615
00:40:33,471 --> 00:40:34,953
so I'll just take him home...

616
00:40:34,954 --> 00:40:39,348
Until I reunite the
shattered aspect of him.

617
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:43,054
And then I'm able to help move him on.

618
00:40:43,055 --> 00:40:47,863
The other thing I want to talk to you about
is the fact that you are a sensitive,

619
00:40:47,864 --> 00:40:49,865
and your daughter is a sensitive.

620
00:40:49,866 --> 00:40:53,761
And there's things that you need to do now

621
00:40:53,762 --> 00:40:57,749
to make it a comfortable
environment for her.

622
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,994
For you, what this is...
this is gaining knowledge,

623
00:41:00,995 --> 00:41:03,868
learning how to control your environment.

624
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:06,488
And your daughter's environment,
and teaching her those skills,

625
00:41:06,489 --> 00:41:10,032
so she can protect herself as well.

626
00:41:10,033 --> 00:41:13,047
Let me ask you a question. What about him?
How does he help her?

627
00:41:13,048 --> 00:41:18,134
The main thing is for right
now is just being supportive.

628
00:41:18,135 --> 00:41:20,087
It's really tough to think,

629
00:41:20,088 --> 00:41:23,091
that they were experiencing more
than I was this entire time,

630
00:41:23,092 --> 00:41:24,607
both my wife and my daughter.

631
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:26,745
You know, you're trying to protect 'em.

632
00:41:26,746 --> 00:41:28,310
Now are you gonna be all right
doing this with your daughter,

633
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:29,595
you gonna be comfortable with it?

634
00:41:29,596 --> 00:41:31,368
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah.

635
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:32,975
And you guys are gonna do this stuff?

636
00:41:32,976 --> 00:41:35,189
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

637
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,987
The good news is you don't have to leave.

638
00:41:37,988 --> 00:41:40,628
Very good news.

639
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:43,678
Thank you.
