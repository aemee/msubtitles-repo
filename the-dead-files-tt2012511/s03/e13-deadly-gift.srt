Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:08,069
Oh, yeah, this is creepy.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,139
We've heard things. We've been touched.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,188
He can get physical if he wants to.

5
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:16,244
My daughter talks about seeing things.

6
00:00:16,245 --> 00:00:19,108
It looked like a Grim Reaper.

7
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,482
The death was suspicious.

8
00:00:21,483 --> 00:00:24,723
He was killed instantly.

9
00:00:25,048 --> 00:00:26,941
So you feel that whatever's
here wants you out?

10
00:00:26,942 --> 00:00:28,986
Absolutely.

11
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:32,287
He wants to hurt people.

12
00:00:33,495 --> 00:00:36,033
They're being watched.

13
00:00:36,034 --> 00:00:38,941
My name is Amy Allan.

14
00:00:38,942 --> 00:00:41,192
This thing likes death.

15
00:00:41,193 --> 00:00:42,975
I see dead people.

16
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,543
This thing is, like, a monster.

17
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,613
I speak to dead people.

18
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:48,303
And he's pissed off now.

19
00:00:48,304 --> 00:00:49,812
And they speak to me.

20
00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:51,408
His head was cracked.

21
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:54,388
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

22
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:56,438
This guy was murdered.

23
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:57,857
I rely on my partner.

24
00:00:57,858 --> 00:00:59,261
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

25
00:00:59,262 --> 00:01:01,212
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

26
00:01:01,213 --> 00:01:03,930
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

27
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:07,023
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

28
00:01:07,024 --> 00:01:09,936
You saw her? It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,089
Why would you stay here?

30
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,213
But Steve and I never speak...

31
00:01:13,214 --> 00:01:15,197
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:15,198 --> 00:01:16,609
Until the very end.

33
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,383
Stop it.

34
00:01:18,384 --> 00:01:20,547
We uncover if it's safe for you to stay...

35
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:22,953
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

36
00:01:22,954 --> 00:01:24,284
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:28,965
I told you there were ghosts in this house.

38
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:55,828
Amy and I conduct our
investigations separately.

39
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:59,314
I interview witnesses and dig
into the history of the location.

40
00:01:59,315 --> 00:02:03,070
While Amy communicates with the dead.

41
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:07,556
At the end, we get together
to reveal our findings.

42
00:02:07,557 --> 00:02:13,457
I'm in Wichita, Kansas, on my way to a
property owned by a husband-and-wife team.

43
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:19,626
They run a beauty salon and an
auto shop on the same property.

44
00:02:19,627 --> 00:02:23,230
The husband Jeff says violent spirits
are destroying his business,

45
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:27,311
their family life, and their sanity.

46
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:42,357
Amy needs to be free from outside
influences during her walk.

47
00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:47,302
So it's important that I cover
or remove all photographs,

48
00:02:47,303 --> 00:02:51,203
artwork, and even religious icons.

49
00:02:52,294 --> 00:02:58,194
Once I'm done, the building will
be clear for tonight's walk.

50
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:29,409
Uh, well, I'm not open at all.

51
00:03:32,267 --> 00:03:38,167
I usually open to communicate with
the dead as I approach a location.

52
00:03:38,572 --> 00:03:44,472
But this area has such an overwhelming
amount of death surrounding it...

53
00:03:46,243 --> 00:03:51,583
That I decided to do my
opening inside the location.

54
...
...
...
615
00:40:33,471 --> 00:40:34,953
so I'll just take him home...

616
00:40:34,954 --> 00:40:39,348
Until I reunite the
shattered aspect of him.

617
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:43,054
And then I'm able to help move him on.

618
00:40:43,055 --> 00:40:47,863
The other thing I want to talk to you about
is the fact that you are a sensitive,

619
00:40:47,864 --> 00:40:49,865
and your daughter is a sensitive.

620
00:40:49,866 --> 00:40:53,761
And there's things that you need to do now

621
00:40:53,762 --> 00:40:57,749
to make it a comfortable
environment for her.

622
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,994
For you, what this is...
this is gaining knowledge,

623
00:41:00,995 --> 00:41:03,868
learning how to control your environment.

624
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:06,488
And your daughter's environment,
and teaching her those skills,

625
00:41:06,489 --> 00:41:10,032
so she can protect herself as well.

626
00:41:10,033 --> 00:41:13,047
Let me ask you a question. What about him?
How does he help her?

627
00:41:13,048 --> 00:41:18,134
The main thing is for right
now is just being supportive.

628
00:41:18,135 --> 00:41:20,087
It's really tough to think,

629
00:41:20,088 --> 00:41:23,091
that they were experiencing more
than I was this entire time,

630
00:41:23,092 --> 00:41:24,607
both my wife and my daughter.

631
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:26,745
You know, you're trying to protect 'em.

632
00:41:26,746 --> 00:41:28,310
Now are you gonna be all right
doing this with your daughter,

633
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:29,595
you gonna be comfortable with it?

634
00:41:29,596 --> 00:41:31,368
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah.

635
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:32,975
And you guys are gonna do this stuff?

636
00:41:32,976 --> 00:41:35,189
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

637
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,987
The good news is you don't have to leave.

638
00:41:37,988 --> 00:41:40,628
Very good news.

639
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:43,678
Thank you.
