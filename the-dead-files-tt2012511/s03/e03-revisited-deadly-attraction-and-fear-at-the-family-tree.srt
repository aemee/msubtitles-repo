2
00:00:05,828 --> 00:00:08,089
- Tonight..
- Stop it.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,510
On "Dead Files Revisited"..

4
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:16,123
A second look at some of Amy and
Steve's most terrifying cases..

5
00:00:16,124 --> 00:00:17,586
Ooh, look.

6
00:00:17,587 --> 00:00:20,472
- New information..
- It was horrifying to hear.

7
00:00:20,473 --> 00:00:22,069
Startling revelations.

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,875
I was afraid of what she was gonna find.

9
00:00:24,876 --> 00:00:27,001
- First..
- Stop it.

10
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:31,417
A return to Wichita, Kansas, where
a woman's violent encounters..

11
00:00:31,418 --> 00:00:33,185
The veins all started popping out.

12
00:00:33,186 --> 00:00:36,390
Left her family fearing for their lives.

13
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:37,911
It's weird.

14
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:41,066
And Amy sensed the
house wasn't the problem.

15
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:43,879
If this thing gets in,
you'll lose your mind.

16
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,860
Then..

17
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:49,036
We travel back to Santaquin, Utah..

18
00:00:49,037 --> 00:00:51,099
Apparitions here follow us home.

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,339
Where a family Restaurant
held an awful secret..

20
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,041
They're all dead together.

21
00:00:56,042 --> 00:00:58,770
And horror lurked in the shadows.

22
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:01,995
- I couldn't hardly even look at it.
- Oh, my God.

23
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:04,130
It's like a little pit of hell.

24
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:06,500
Did they follow Amy's advice?

25
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:12,401
If Amy told you you better not stay here,
you gotta get out, what would you do?

26
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:18,701
There's something down there.

27
00:01:18,702 --> 00:01:21,822
My name is Amy Allan.

28
00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:24,970
A lot of dead people are here.

29
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:26,071
I see dead people.

30
00:01:26,072 --> 00:01:27,639
This is not good.

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,908
I speak to dead people..

32
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:31,538
He is very pissed off.

33
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:32,944
And they speak to me..

34
00:01:32,945 --> 00:01:34,480
The house is angry.

35
00:01:34,481 --> 00:01:37,516
But there's only way to
know if my findings are real.

36
00:01:37,517 --> 00:01:39,218
He's killed people.

37
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:41,086
I rely on my partner.

38
00:01:41,087 --> 00:01:42,536
I'm Steve Dischiavi.

39
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:44,523
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective..

40
00:01:44,524 --> 00:01:46,073
He got shot at his house?

41
00:01:46,074 --> 00:01:48,994
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

42
00:01:48,995 --> 00:01:50,507
Aren't you terrified being here?

43
00:01:50,508 --> 00:01:51,767
It's my job to reveal 'em.

44
00:01:51,768 --> 00:01:53,833
That sounds like something
out of "The Exorcist".

45
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:55,967
But Steve and I never speak..

46
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,903
We never communicate
during an investigation.

47
00:01:57,904 --> 00:01:59,238
Until the very end.

48
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,596
It's bad.

49
00:02:00,597 --> 00:02:02,674
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay..

50
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:04,109
I'd like some answers.

51
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,110
Or time to get out.

52
00:02:24,363 --> 00:02:29,823
Our investigation in Wichita
was one I'll never forget.

53
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:34,304
Our client Kristen sent me a
video that was really intense.

54
00:02:34,305 --> 00:02:36,408
Look. Ewe!

55
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:40,009
I've never seen this before.

56
00:02:41,146 --> 00:02:45,226
I can't stop it. It's gone crazy.

57
00:02:46,744 --> 00:02:49,008
That video? Bizarre stuff.

58
...
...
...
I realize this was a lot
to ask of Leslie and Bobby,

641
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,468
but it's what needed to be done.

642
00:40:00,469 --> 00:40:03,359
That was the only way they were
going to save their Restaurant,

643
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,467
and more importantly, release the
innocent dead that were trapped there.

644
00:40:07,468 --> 00:40:10,446
- What are you gonna do?
- We'll move on to getting it blessed.

645
00:40:10,447 --> 00:40:13,848
Sounds like a lot of
steps, but we'll take 'em.

646
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:15,849
Well, you guys are pretty
passionate about this Restaurant.

647
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,301
It sounds like you want the fight.

648
00:40:17,302 --> 00:40:19,103
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

649
00:40:19,104 --> 00:40:23,844
You are. You're fighting
for your life here.

650
00:40:39,123 --> 00:40:43,443
Thank you again, ladies. Appreciate you.

651
00:40:55,106 --> 00:40:58,966
Amy told us that we needed
to get the curse lifted.

652
00:40:58,967 --> 00:41:02,447
And have the place blessed.

653
00:41:02,897 --> 00:41:08,797
But it's just really scary just to
trust anybody with my Restaurant.

654
00:41:11,085 --> 00:41:14,308
The activity has definitely increased.

655
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:18,269
I don't feel safe here any more.

656
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:25,252
At this point, leaving the Restaurant
to my daughter Bobby is not an option.

657
00:41:26,045 --> 00:41:30,545
I'm really worried
about her safety here.

658
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:40,935
It's a shame that Leslie and Bobby didn't
keep their promise to cleanse the property.

659
00:41:42,475 --> 00:41:46,083
And I'm not surprised to find
out the activity has increased.

660
00:41:46,084 --> 00:41:49,247
Until they take action, I'm worried
about what could happen to them,

661
00:41:49,248 --> 00:41:53,088
their employees, and their patrons.

662
