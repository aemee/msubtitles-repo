Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:06,414 --> 00:00:08,069
You hear that?

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,971
He's stalking them.

4
00:00:09,972 --> 00:00:12,390
My wife was assaulted here.

5
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:14,129
It hurts.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,678
I felt this push.

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,279
Looks like a scratch mark.

8
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,705
Really dangerous situation.

9
00:00:18,706 --> 00:00:20,555
Within two minutes
he's dead on the street.

10
00:00:20,556 --> 00:00:22,691
I see a lot of brains.

11
00:00:22,692 --> 00:00:24,600
Holy [Bleep].

12
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:27,507
She was tried for first-degree murder.

13
00:00:27,508 --> 00:00:30,893
She's, like, trying to reach out.

14
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:34,734
There's something very bad here.

15
00:00:35,562 --> 00:00:38,233
They're being watched.

16
00:00:38,234 --> 00:00:40,976
My name is Amy Allan.

17
00:00:40,977 --> 00:00:43,681
This thing likes death.

18
00:00:43,682 --> 00:00:44,963
I see dead people.

19
00:00:44,964 --> 00:00:46,593
This thing is, like, a monster.

20
00:00:46,594 --> 00:00:48,428
I speak to dead people...

21
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:50,329
And he's pissed off now.

22
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,811
And they speak to me.

23
00:00:51,812 --> 00:00:53,391
His head was cracked.

24
00:00:53,392 --> 00:00:56,752
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

25
00:00:56,753 --> 00:00:58,531
This guy was murdered.

26
00:00:58,532 --> 00:00:59,915
I rely on my partner.

27
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,304
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

28
00:01:01,305 --> 00:01:03,252
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

29
00:01:03,253 --> 00:01:05,855
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

30
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:09,158
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

31
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:11,861
You saw her? It's my job to reveal them.

32
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:13,131
Why would you stay here?

33
00:01:13,132 --> 00:01:15,286
But Steve and I never speak...

34
00:01:15,287 --> 00:01:17,221
We never communicate
during an investigation.

35
00:01:17,222 --> 00:01:18,690
Until the very end.

36
00:01:18,691 --> 00:01:20,424
Stop it.

37
00:01:20,425 --> 00:01:22,393
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

38
00:01:22,394 --> 00:01:24,930
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

39
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:26,246
Or time to get out.

40
00:01:26,247 --> 00:01:30,987
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

41
00:01:47,753 --> 00:01:50,393
Amy and I conduct our
investigations separately.

42
00:01:50,394 --> 00:01:55,328
I interview witnesses, local experts,
and dig into the history of the location.

43
00:01:55,329 --> 00:02:01,229
At the end we reveal our findings to the
clients and each other for the first time.

44
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:03,090
I'm in Columbus, Ohio.

45
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:06,278
We've been called in by
this guy named Harold.

46
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:08,103
He owns a restaurant
with his wife in town,

47
00:02:08,104 --> 00:02:12,797
and he says there's violent spirits
attacking his wife and his employees.

48
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:17,718
I'm hoping Amy and I
can straighten this out.

49
00:02:23,596 --> 00:02:25,399
Before Amy enters a location.

50
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,203
I clear the area of anything
that could influence her findings.

51
00:02:31,204 --> 00:02:34,454
This restaurant has a lot of
photographs and historical items.

52
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:40,355
So it's important that I cover or
remove them before Amy begins her walk.

53
00:02:51,724 --> 00:02:55,204
There's too much going on.

54
00:03:07,627 --> 00:03:11,759
I saw this dead lady
who's depressed, and...

55
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,260
I saw things moving. I saw a chair move.

56
...
...
...
than if it had been a shadow
person or some kind of evil entity.

643
00:40:23,174 --> 00:40:27,914
With him, his main
weakness is his religion.

644
00:40:29,563 --> 00:40:32,569
Using the religion is
bringing in a man of the cloth,

645
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:37,010
to do a blessing of the entire location.

646
00:40:37,016 --> 00:40:40,736
That's going to keep him out.

647
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:45,532
Once you do this, there will be
no dead that can enter this place.

648
00:40:45,533 --> 00:40:47,407
And no dead that remain.

649
00:40:47,408 --> 00:40:51,688
Just because I am slightly worried about
him, we're going to see how things go.

650
00:40:51,689 --> 00:40:54,031
If things are still happening...

651
00:40:54,032 --> 00:40:58,652
Then we might have
to go for an exorcism.

652
00:41:00,401 --> 00:41:02,743
It's almost empowering to feel that

653
00:41:02,744 --> 00:41:04,830
- we can kick these guys out.
- Mm hmm.

654
00:41:04,831 --> 00:41:08,969
I feel good that we can,
uh, protect our staff,

655
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,680
and we can send everyone on their way.

656
00:41:10,681 --> 00:41:12,801
And... and you guys are
definitely gonna do this?

657
00:41:12,802 --> 00:41:14,507
- Yeah. Oh, yes.
- Okay.

658
00:41:14,508 --> 00:41:18,711
Now are you gonna be a little afraid
to go upstairs to your office tomorrow?

659
00:41:18,712 --> 00:41:23,149
I'm a little creeped
out, but I'm prepared.

660
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,951
And there's light at the
end of the tunnel here.

661
00:41:24,952 --> 00:41:27,153
Yeah, absolutely.

662
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:29,724
I really hope Elizabeth
and Harold follow my advice,

663
00:41:29,725 --> 00:41:32,442
and rid their restaurant of
the entities that inhabit it.

664
00:41:32,443 --> 00:41:35,194
If they don't, I fear
not only for their safety,

665
00:41:35,195 --> 00:41:39,755
but their employees
and customers as well.
