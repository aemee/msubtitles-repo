Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:05,734 --> 00:00:08,768
Tonight on "Dead Files Revisited"...

3
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:10,033
This is nuts.

4
00:00:10,034 --> 00:00:14,023
A second look at some of Amy and
Steve's most terrifying cases.

5
00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:15,603
I'm getting chills up and down my back.

6
00:00:15,604 --> 00:00:16,953
New information.

7
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:18,438
We were getting to the bottom of it.

8
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:20,055
Startling revelations.

9
00:00:20,056 --> 00:00:21,682
It was so weird.

10
00:00:21,683 --> 00:00:25,086
First... a return to
Cedar Park, Texas...

11
00:00:25,087 --> 00:00:26,620
I don't come out here at night.

12
00:00:26,621 --> 00:00:28,560
Where a home was under siege.

13
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:30,021
They burned it down.

14
00:00:30,022 --> 00:00:32,809
Amy exposes monsters
lurking in the trees.

15
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,932
- I see exactly what you just described.
- Lord.

16
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:37,405
But one question remained.

17
00:00:37,406 --> 00:00:40,253
- How afraid should I be?
- What?

18
00:00:40,254 --> 00:00:41,309
Then...

19
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,371
It was really crazy.

20
00:00:43,372 --> 00:00:45,940
We travel back to Ybor City, Florida...

21
00:00:45,941 --> 00:00:47,776
A lot of dead people are here.

22
00:00:47,777 --> 00:00:51,397
Where a landmark hotel
hides a sinister past.

23
00:00:51,398 --> 00:00:52,781
It was a ghost.

24
00:00:52,782 --> 00:00:56,017
- What happened after the investigation?
- It was a lot of pressure.

25
00:00:56,018 --> 00:00:58,154
And how did it change their lives?

26
00:00:58,155 --> 00:01:03,495
When you see an apparition,
you will never forget it.

27
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,519
There's something down there.

28
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,640
My name is Amy Allan.

29
00:01:09,357 --> 00:01:11,659
A lot of dead people are here.

30
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,328
I see dead people. This is not good.

31
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:16,598
I speak to dead people...

32
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,399
He is very pissed off.

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,182
And they speak to me...
the house is angry.

34
00:01:21,183 --> 00:01:24,171
But there's only way to
know if my findings are real.

35
00:01:24,172 --> 00:01:26,404
He's killed people.

36
00:01:26,405 --> 00:01:27,968
I rely on my partner.

37
00:01:27,969 --> 00:01:29,393
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

38
00:01:29,394 --> 00:01:31,272
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective...

39
00:01:31,273 --> 00:01:32,880
He got shot at his house?

40
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:35,970
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

41
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,506
Aren't you terrified being
here? It's my job to reveal 'em.

42
00:01:38,507 --> 00:01:40,622
That sounds like something
out of "The Exorcist."

43
00:01:40,623 --> 00:01:42,757
But Steve and I never speak...

44
00:01:42,758 --> 00:01:44,640
We never communicate
during an investigation.

45
00:01:44,641 --> 00:01:46,144
Until the very end.

46
00:01:46,145 --> 00:01:47,330
It's bad.

47
00:01:47,331 --> 00:01:49,464
And we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

48
00:01:49,465 --> 00:01:50,832
I'd like some answers.

49
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,833
Or time to get out.

50
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,889
I've heard a lot of strange things
since I started working with Amy.

51
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:19,549
But our investigation in Cedar Park,
Texas, still makes my head spin.

52
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,562
We were called in by
a woman named Annie.

53
00:02:21,563 --> 00:02:27,463
Who thought the activity around her
home was making her physically ill.

54
00:02:30,174 --> 00:02:32,579
I'm so glad you're here.

55
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,841
What's going on?

56
00:02:33,842 --> 00:02:39,029
...
...
...
645
00:40:13,678 --> 00:40:16,211
Looking back Jack and Tessa were lucky.

646
00:40:16,212 --> 00:40:18,126
There were a lot of dead
people in the basement,

647
00:40:18,127 --> 00:40:20,653
and it's fortunate none
of them were dangerous.

648
00:40:20,654 --> 00:40:22,642
They just needed help moving on.

649
00:40:22,643 --> 00:40:25,454
You are safe, the guests are safe.

650
00:40:25,455 --> 00:40:30,196
And the nurse is still working and
doing her job taking care of everybody.

651
00:40:30,197 --> 00:40:33,363
That's what we want is a happy place.

652
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:37,650
After the reveal I recommended
a very strict cleansing process.

653
00:40:37,651 --> 00:40:41,947
It was going to take a lot of time
to remove that many dead people.

654
00:40:41,948 --> 00:40:47,528
And I can remember thinking,
I hope they take my advice.

655
00:41:05,316 --> 00:41:11,216
Amy's advice was to do a cleansing
downstairs to release the spirits.

656
00:41:12,016 --> 00:41:16,696
To set them free so
that they can move on.

657
00:41:18,891 --> 00:41:20,610
Since then...

658
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:26,511
My father and I have not seen anything
nor has anybody that works with us.

659
00:41:27,073 --> 00:41:32,484
But when you see an apparition
you will never forget it.

660
00:41:32,485 --> 00:41:35,701
So I still have a little bit of
trepidation about the basement,

661
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:38,004
and I think that that
will always be there.

662
00:41:38,005 --> 00:41:39,864
Hi welcome to the Don Vicente.

663
00:41:39,865 --> 00:41:44,177
But I love what I do,
this is a family business.

664
00:41:44,178 --> 00:41:46,007
It's such a big part of my life.

665
00:41:46,008 --> 00:41:48,571
- Enjoy your stay.
- Thank you.

666
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:51,010
I can breath freely now, knowing that...

667
00:41:51,011 --> 00:41:56,096
The building, our livelihood, our
lives, each other, are all safe.
