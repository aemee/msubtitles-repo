Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:08,116
Tonight on "Dead Files Revisited"...

3
00:00:08,117 --> 00:00:09,333
I was absolutely spooked.

4
00:00:09,334 --> 00:00:13,340
A second look at some of Amy and
Steve's most terrifying cases.

5
00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:14,581
I was scared.

6
00:00:14,582 --> 00:00:15,560
New information.

7
00:00:15,561 --> 00:00:16,903
There was something creepy.

8
00:00:16,904 --> 00:00:18,482
Startling revelations.

9
00:00:18,483 --> 00:00:20,747
This person was and is real.

10
00:00:20,748 --> 00:00:23,984
First... a return to
Asbury Park, New Jersey...

11
00:00:23,985 --> 00:00:25,661
You must be frightened coming down here.

12
00:00:25,662 --> 00:00:28,060
Where a Restaurant hides
a dangerous entity.

13
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,397
It makes my hair stand up.

14
00:00:29,398 --> 00:00:30,504
Very angry.

15
00:00:30,505 --> 00:00:33,069
Amy exposes evil lurking in the basement.

16
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,730
Have you ever been so scared?

17
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:38,490
And Steve comes face-to-face
with a murderer.

18
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:40,567
Did you want to kill him?

19
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:43,654
Then we travel back to
Vancouver, Washington...

20
00:00:43,655 --> 00:00:44,856
It's crazy.

21
00:00:44,857 --> 00:00:47,423
Where a local theater's sinister past...

22
00:00:47,424 --> 00:00:49,240
That's pretty sick.

23
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:51,511
Puts innocent children in danger.

24
00:00:51,512 --> 00:00:53,934
Is it safe for those kids
to come into the theater?

25
00:00:53,935 --> 00:00:55,365
But did they listen to Amy?

26
00:00:55,366 --> 00:00:56,909
What do they do if it doesn't stop?

27
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,272
Or did they continue to live in fear?

28
00:00:59,273 --> 00:01:02,753
I haven't been back since.

29
00:01:03,957 --> 00:01:06,045
There's something down there.

30
00:01:06,046 --> 00:01:09,166
My name is Amy Allan.

31
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:12,172
A lot of dead people are here.

32
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:13,497
I see dead people.

33
00:01:13,498 --> 00:01:15,072
This is not good.

34
00:01:15,073 --> 00:01:17,185
I speak to dead people...

35
00:01:17,186 --> 00:01:18,714
He is very pissed off.

36
00:01:18,715 --> 00:01:20,326
And they speak to me...

37
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:21,808
The house is angry.

38
00:01:21,809 --> 00:01:24,978
But there's only way to know
if my findings are real.

39
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:26,679
He's killed people.

40
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,469
I rely on my partner.

41
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,816
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

42
00:01:29,817 --> 00:01:31,930
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective...

43
00:01:31,931 --> 00:01:33,365
He got shot at his house?

44
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:36,456
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

45
00:01:36,457 --> 00:01:39,126
Aren't you terrified being here?
It's my job to reveal 'em.

46
00:01:39,127 --> 00:01:41,201
That sounds like something
out of "The Exorcist."

47
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:43,251
But Steve and I never speak...

48
00:01:43,252 --> 00:01:45,226
We never communicate
during an investigation.

49
00:01:45,227 --> 00:01:46,629
Until the very end.

50
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,892
It's bad.

51
00:01:47,893 --> 00:01:49,961
And we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

52
00:01:49,962 --> 00:01:51,340
I'd like some answers.

53
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:54,341
Or time to get out.

54
00:02:12,892 --> 00:02:15,895
One of the first cases that Amy
and I ever worked on together

55
00:02:15,896 --> 00:02:19,102
was in Asbury Park, New Jersey.

56
00:02:19,103 --> 00:02:22,520
We had gotten a call from Jeffrey,
the owner of Plan B Restaurant.

57
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:25,268
Both he and his employees were
having strange experiences

58
...
...
...
I think he needs a stern talking-to,
because he is being a hypocrite.

639
00:40:16,045 --> 00:40:18,938
He is saying he wants to be left alone...

640
00:40:18,939 --> 00:40:22,299
And yet he's harassing...

641
00:40:23,052 --> 00:40:25,235
People. So that needs to stop.

642
00:40:25,236 --> 00:40:30,097
Then go down there as a group and be like,
"that's your space, you hang out there.

643
00:40:30,098 --> 00:40:32,926
"We'll respect that, if you respect us.

644
00:40:32,927 --> 00:40:37,538
If you don't respect us, then
you're gonna have to go."

645
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:40,000
But the most pressing question is,

646
00:40:40,001 --> 00:40:45,281
is it safe for those kids
to come into the theater?

647
00:40:56,858 --> 00:41:01,744
Amy told us it was safe
for the kids to be there.

648
00:41:01,745 --> 00:41:06,098
But the Slocum House has this
dark, oppressive energy.

649
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:09,854
And we were hoping to get away from that.

650
00:41:09,855 --> 00:41:15,755
So a couple of weeks after the
investigation, we decided to move.

651
00:41:15,836 --> 00:41:18,656
And it was, uh...

652
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:21,620
It was kind of devastating to leave.

653
00:41:21,621 --> 00:41:25,161
But we needed to feel safe.

654
00:41:30,304 --> 00:41:34,684
At the new space things are looking up.

655
00:41:34,874 --> 00:41:36,899
We still have a ways to go.

656
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:42,060
So far we haven't noticed
anything, but who knows?

657
00:41:43,203 --> 00:41:45,424
Sometimes it's hard for
people to stay somewhere

658
00:41:45,425 --> 00:41:48,208
once they learn what's really going on.

659
00:41:48,209 --> 00:41:51,774
So I can understand why Rebecca
and her staff left the theater.

660
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,949
But that means the 7-foot-tall
man still remains.

661
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:59,824
So my advice to the next tenant is be
ready to put this guy in his place.
