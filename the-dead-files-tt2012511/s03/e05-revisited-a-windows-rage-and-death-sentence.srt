Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:06,810
Tonight...

3
00:00:06,811 --> 00:00:08,191
Physical pain here.

4
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:10,786
On "Dead Files Revisited"...

5
00:00:10,787 --> 00:00:15,167
A second look at some of Amy and
Steve's most terrifying cases.

6
00:00:15,168 --> 00:00:16,733
It's kind of creepy.

7
00:00:16,734 --> 00:00:18,117
New information.

8
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:19,687
Scared the hell out of me.

9
00:00:19,688 --> 00:00:21,289
Startling revelations.

10
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,273
My fear was real.

11
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:27,174
First a return to Uriah, Alabama.

12
00:00:27,283 --> 00:00:28,664
Where violent encounters...

13
00:00:28,665 --> 00:00:30,296
I fell through the ceiling.

14
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:32,035
Were just the beginning.

15
00:00:32,036 --> 00:00:34,129
I heard a little girl scream.

16
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,624
What happened after the investigation?

17
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,959
It was terrifying.

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,097
- Then...
- A lot of blood in my mouth.

19
00:00:41,098 --> 00:00:43,531
We travel back to
Santa Fe, New Mexico...

20
00:00:43,532 --> 00:00:44,874
It was haunted.

21
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:48,002
To a notorious prison overrun by evil.

22
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:50,843
Far worse than any demon.

23
00:00:50,844 --> 00:00:54,275
The monster turns one
woman's world into hell...

24
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:56,147
Somebody can see into my head.

25
00:00:56,148 --> 00:00:58,381
And leads to a life-changing decision.

26
00:00:58,382 --> 00:00:59,638
It was a bad idea.

27
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:01,889
Did she follow Amy's advice?

28
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,830
I can't even look.

29
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:08,890
There's something down there.

30
00:01:08,891 --> 00:01:12,011
My name is Amy Allan.

31
00:01:12,694 --> 00:01:14,995
A lot of dead people are here.

32
00:01:14,996 --> 00:01:16,294
I see dead people.

33
00:01:16,295 --> 00:01:17,665
This is not good.

34
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,967
I speak to dead people...

35
00:01:19,968 --> 00:01:21,769
He is very pissed off.

36
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,161
And they speak to me...

37
00:01:23,162 --> 00:01:24,371
The house is angry.

38
00:01:24,372 --> 00:01:27,542
But there's only way to
know if my findings are real.

39
00:01:27,543 --> 00:01:29,243
He's killed people.

40
00:01:29,244 --> 00:01:31,111
I rely on my partner.

41
00:01:31,112 --> 00:01:32,647
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

42
00:01:32,648 --> 00:01:34,582
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective...

43
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,250
He got shot at his house?

44
00:01:36,251 --> 00:01:39,019
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

45
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,443
Aren't you terrified being here?

46
00:01:40,444 --> 00:01:41,689
It's my job to reveal 'em.

47
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,991
That sounds like something
out of "The Exorcist."

48
00:01:43,992 --> 00:01:46,126
But Steve and I never speak...

49
00:01:46,127 --> 00:01:47,762
We never communicate
during an investigation.

50
00:01:47,763 --> 00:01:49,396
Until the very end.

51
00:01:49,397 --> 00:01:50,574
It's bad.

52
00:01:50,575 --> 00:01:52,834
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

53
00:01:52,835 --> 00:01:54,201
I'd like some answers.

54
00:01:54,202 --> 00:01:57,202
Or time to get out.

55
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:14,511
This investigation took us to a
tiny town in Alabama called Uriah.

56
00:02:14,512 --> 00:02:17,932
About an hour from Mobile.

57
00:02:24,107 --> 00:02:28,135
The investigation started with
a call from a woman named Robin.

58
00:02:28,136 --> 00:02:32,439
She's never believed in the paranormal,
but sometimes a near-death experience

59
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,820
...
...
...
because then things started
happening in my house.

607
00:39:32,192 --> 00:39:34,412
Hmm, boy.

608
00:39:36,284 --> 00:39:40,644
So I burned it, but I
burned it in the fireplace.

609
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:44,305
- In the house.
- Oh, [Bleep].

610
00:39:47,963 --> 00:39:53,863
What I'm thinking is that you brought
a little piece of this negative...

611
00:39:55,937 --> 00:39:58,457
To your home.

612
00:40:14,222 --> 00:40:17,702
What you need to have happen...

613
00:40:17,703 --> 00:40:21,243
Is for a medicine man, to..

614
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,947
Come to your house...

615
00:40:23,948 --> 00:40:26,071
And do...

616
00:40:26,072 --> 00:40:29,132
A... Ritual cleansing.

617
00:40:29,142 --> 00:40:33,586
The other thing is that you need
a cleansing ritual of your body,

618
00:40:33,587 --> 00:40:36,952
because it does like to attach.

619
00:40:36,953 --> 00:40:40,193
In a very physical way.

620
00:40:41,762 --> 00:40:45,420
These two things need to
be happening simultaneously.

621
00:40:45,421 --> 00:40:47,341
Okay?

622
00:40:54,271 --> 00:40:57,691
You gonna take her advice?

623
00:41:15,365 --> 00:41:19,321
I did have a medicine
man come to my home.

624
00:41:19,322 --> 00:41:22,562
We walked room to room.

625
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,760
And we prayed.

626
00:41:33,127 --> 00:41:35,111
I did not get a body cleanse.

627
00:41:35,112 --> 00:41:38,484
I really didn't feel like I needed it.

628
00:41:38,485 --> 00:41:42,115
I believe the devil, his minions...

629
00:41:42,116 --> 00:41:45,116
They can't hurt me.

630
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,072
If Sandi's medicine man
performed a proper cleansing,

631
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:50,992
her home should be safer than it was.

632
00:41:50,993 --> 00:41:55,224
But this thing is also
attracted to her personally.

633
00:41:55,225 --> 00:42:00,101
So until she cleanses herself,
I believe she's still in danger.
