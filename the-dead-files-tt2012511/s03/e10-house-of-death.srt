Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:05,555 --> 00:00:08,557
There's something lurking in the dark here.

3
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:11,093
Not too comfortable with
this house at night.

4
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:13,128
He loves the death.

5
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:15,130
It's really disturbing.

6
00:00:15,131 --> 00:00:17,299
It makes me physically sick.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,401
Previous owner killed
himself in that bathtub?

8
00:00:19,402 --> 00:00:22,671
He sliced his throat, right at the jugular.

9
00:00:22,672 --> 00:00:25,140
People are freaking the [Bleep] out.

10
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:27,176
I really don't want to be in the dark here.

11
00:00:27,177 --> 00:00:29,952
- Are you okay?
- No.

12
00:00:29,953 --> 00:00:33,313
It's the house of death.

13
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:36,657
They're being watched.

14
00:00:36,658 --> 00:00:39,559
My name is Amy Allan.

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,239
This thing likes death.

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,467
I see dead people.

17
00:00:43,468 --> 00:00:45,236
This thing is, like, a monster.

18
00:00:45,237 --> 00:00:47,038
I speak to dead people...

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,073
And he's pissed off now.

20
00:00:49,074 --> 00:00:50,415
And they speak to me.

21
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:51,922
His head was cracked.

22
00:00:51,923 --> 00:00:54,778
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

23
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:56,780
This guy was murdered.

24
00:00:56,781 --> 00:00:58,382
I rely on my partner.

25
00:00:58,383 --> 00:00:59,866
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

26
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:01,797
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

27
00:01:01,798 --> 00:01:04,521
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

28
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:07,725
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

29
00:01:07,726 --> 00:01:10,394
You saw her? It's my job to reveal them.

30
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:11,758
Why would you stay here?

31
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:13,781
But Steve and I never speak...

32
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,725
We never communicate
during an investigation.

33
00:01:15,726 --> 00:01:17,152
Until the very end.

34
00:01:17,153 --> 00:01:19,036
Stop it.

35
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,120
We uncover if it's safe for you to stay...

36
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:23,479
I want to know the truth.
I want to know what's happening.

37
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,778
Or time to get out.

38
00:01:24,779 --> 00:01:29,459
I told you there were ghosts in this house.

39
00:01:51,303 --> 00:01:55,849
Amy and I never cross paths
during our investigations.

40
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,975
I gather witnesses
accounts, expert opinions,

41
00:01:58,976 --> 00:02:02,372
and research the history of the location.

42
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:06,794
While Amy investigates what
most people can't see.

43
00:02:06,795 --> 00:02:12,195
When we're done, we meet up
and reveal our findings.

44
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:19,289
I'm in the small town of
Clinton, North Carolina.

45
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,292
It's about 45 minutes
outside of Fayetteville.

46
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:26,763
I got a call from a woman named Kara
who runs the art center in town.

47
00:02:26,764 --> 00:02:31,101
She said that people that work for her
are seeing all kinds of weird stuff.

48
00:02:31,102 --> 00:02:33,506
And Kara's worried that
whatever's going on there,

49
00:02:33,507 --> 00:02:38,727
might shut down the center
that she loves so much.

50
00:02:50,652 --> 00:02:55,710
Amy needs to be free from outside
influences during her walk.

51
00:02:55,711 --> 00:03:00,616
So it's important that I cover all the
artwork and personal items at the location.

52
00:03:00,617 --> 00:03:06,517
Once I'm done, the building will
be ready for tonight's walk.

53
00:03:33,352 --> 00:03:37,252

...
...
...
621
00:40:31,864 --> 00:40:34,707
He does have issues, I'm not gonna lie.

622
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:40,145
Um, but I think that if you're willing
to do this, you can help him.

623
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:43,721
And you can fix the situation here as well.

624
00:40:43,722 --> 00:40:45,326
Okay.

625
00:40:45,327 --> 00:40:49,106
Then what you're going to want
to do is contact a death medium.

626
00:40:49,107 --> 00:40:54,732
Like me, who can come in and do a cleansing
from top to bottom, inside and out.

627
00:40:54,733 --> 00:40:58,730
If this is done properly, it should get
rid of all the entities that are here.

628
00:40:58,731 --> 00:41:01,076
And hopefully that can
be done fairly easily.

629
00:41:01,077 --> 00:41:04,642
If not, there may have
to be another session.

630
00:41:04,643 --> 00:41:07,747
Listen, are you okay? This is a lot...
a lot of pressure for you.

631
00:41:07,748 --> 00:41:10,181
A little overwhelmed, I'm not gonna lie.

632
00:41:10,182 --> 00:41:13,151
You know, there's a light at the
end of this tunnel, though.

633
00:41:13,152 --> 00:41:17,923
If you do do this, and you're strong
enough to do it, kids could come back.

634
00:41:17,924 --> 00:41:22,029
Now are you gonna be able to follow through
with all of this and help out with this?

635
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:25,840
We're definitely gonna do
what Amy has suggested.

636
00:41:25,841 --> 00:41:28,950
Because we want, you know,
everything to end, and...

637
00:41:28,951 --> 00:41:33,151
I'm confident that we can settle it.

638
00:41:34,187 --> 00:41:37,405
I really hope that Kara and Ashley
follow through with my advice,

639
00:41:37,406 --> 00:41:40,912
and release this house of all
the entities that lurk inside.

640
00:41:40,913 --> 00:41:44,214
If they do, I'm confident the
staff and visitors here will be

641
00:41:44,215 --> 00:41:50,115
safe from the harm that has been
inflicted on so many people.
