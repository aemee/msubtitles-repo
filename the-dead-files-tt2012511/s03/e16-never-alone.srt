00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:06,008 --> 00:00:09,359
There's this thing. It's really creepy.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,462
Sometimes I feel like I'm being watched.

4
00:00:12,463 --> 00:00:15,766
I see this big, black, massive shadow.

5
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:18,222
There's a girl right there.

6
00:00:18,223 --> 00:00:20,518
She's got blood all over her dress.

7
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:21,953
It's very gruesome.

8
00:00:21,954 --> 00:00:24,656
She likes to play games.

9
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:27,125
The foundation of the house shook.

10
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:29,027
All the energy just went fwoop!

11
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:32,109
I'm being kicked out of my own home.

12
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,870
This isn't good.

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,475
They're being watched.

14
00:00:39,476 --> 00:00:42,383
My name is Amy Allan.

15
00:00:42,384 --> 00:00:44,634
This thing likes death.

16
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:46,417
I see dead people.

17
00:00:46,418 --> 00:00:47,985
This thing is, like, a monster.

18
00:00:47,986 --> 00:00:50,055
I speak to dead people.

19
00:00:50,056 --> 00:00:51,745
And he's pissed off now.

20
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:53,254
And they speak to me.

21
00:00:53,255 --> 00:00:54,850
His head was cracked.

22
00:00:54,851 --> 00:00:57,830
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

23
00:00:57,831 --> 00:00:59,880
This guy was murdered.

24
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:01,299
I rely on my partner.

25
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,703
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

26
00:01:02,704 --> 00:01:04,654
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

27
00:01:04,655 --> 00:01:07,372
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

28
00:01:07,373 --> 00:01:10,465
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

29
00:01:10,466 --> 00:01:13,378
You saw her? It's my job to reveal them.

30
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:14,531
Why would you stay here?

31
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,655
But Steve and I never speak...

32
00:01:16,656 --> 00:01:18,639
We never communicate
during an investigation.

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,051
Until the very end.

34
00:01:20,052 --> 00:01:21,825
Stop it.

35
00:01:21,826 --> 00:01:23,989
We uncover if it's safe for you to stay...

36
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,395
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

37
00:01:26,396 --> 00:01:27,776
Or time to get out.

38
00:01:27,777 --> 00:01:32,457
I told you there were ghosts in this house.

39
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:55,839
Amy and I conduct our
investigations separately.

40
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,039
It's my job to look into the property's
past and hear from the witnesses involved.

41
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,520
While Amy makes contact with the dead.

42
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:06,416
When our investigation is done,

43
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:11,517
we meet with our clients
and reveal our findings.

44
00:02:15,193 --> 00:02:18,168
I'm in Forester, Michigan, a
small waterfront community

45
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:20,679
about an hour and a half from Detroit.

46
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,899
I'm getting ready to meet
with a woman named Chrystal,

47
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,536
who says the house she inherited from
her parents is not only scaring her...

48
00:02:26,537 --> 00:02:30,051
It's tearing her entire family apart.

49
00:02:30,052 --> 00:02:35,952
I hope we can figure out what the
hell's going on in this place.

50
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:49,926
It's obvious from the photos that a
family with at least one kid lives here.

51
00:02:49,927 --> 00:02:52,896
And that could influence Amy's findings.

52
00:02:52,897 --> 00:02:58,797
So it's important that I remove them
all before she can begin her walk.

53
00:03:25,515 --> 00:03:31,215
There's this guy, and all of
a sudden, like, I was him.

54
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,910
That's never happened before in an
opening, where I was the dead person.

55
00:03:39,263 --> 00:03:42,083
Or he was in me.

56
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:46,383
Before I begin my walk, I enter a
meditative state called opening.

57
00:03:46,384 --> 00:03:49,686
This allows me to receive
information from the dead.

58
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:55,587
I felt very uncomfortable because
I felt like I was losing myself.

59
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,979
I don't do that.

60
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,000
I don't let them do that anymore.

61
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:09,839
So, I was pushing him out, but
I couldn't, so I stopped.

62
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,341
Stopped the opening, you mean?

63
00:04:11,342 --> 00:04:13,808
Yes, I stopped the opening.

64
00:04:13,809 --> 00:04:17,229
He was a big, burly dude.

65
00:04:17,781 --> 00:04:22,526
His hands were calloused...
very, very calloused.

66
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:26,727
I'm getting a sharp pain right here.

67
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:34,586
Anyways, he didn't come back
until I was in the yard.

68
00:04:34,587 --> 00:04:35,945
Ah!

69
00:04:35,946 --> 00:04:37,866
Uh...

70
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,069
Uh...

71
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:44,390
Getting a really sharp pain right here.

72
00:05:01,924 --> 00:05:04,220
So, Chrystal, when we spoke
on the phone it sounded like,

73
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:07,197
things are pretty serious
here, what's going on?

74
00:05:07,198 --> 00:05:10,461
We have been experiencing...

75
00:05:10,462 --> 00:05:13,603
Noises, voices, footsteps.

76
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,038
Objects have moved.

77
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,806
Lights going on and off.

78
00:05:16,807 --> 00:05:19,876
My family has seen shadows.

79
00:05:19,877 --> 00:05:23,180
I get very overwhelmed and
emotional, something comes over me.

80
00:05:23,181 --> 00:05:24,851
Like, you feel a presence.

81
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:27,358
Is it getting to the point where
you think it's dangerous here?

82
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:29,425
I feel like it's getting that way.

83
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:33,099
I feel like it's
progressively getting worse.

84
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,896
So, how long have you been living here?

85
00:05:34,897 --> 00:05:36,142
About a year.

86
00:05:36,143 --> 00:05:38,428
I inherited it from my parents.

87
00:05:38,429 --> 00:05:41,537
They were making the house into
a bed-and-breakfast and...

88
00:05:41,538 --> 00:05:44,382
That's kind of why I sold
my home and moved in here,

89
00:05:44,383 --> 00:05:47,194
with my husband and my
three children, because I

90
00:05:47,195 --> 00:05:51,850
want to honor my mom by finishing the
home and making it a bed-and-breakfast.

91
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,494
- Okay, so that's your plans for the house.
- Right.

92
00:05:54,495 --> 00:05:56,989
Chrystal, why is it so
important for you to stay?

93
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,763
Um, I'm attached to this home.

94
00:05:59,764 --> 00:06:02,361
My whole family's attached.

95
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,561
So, obviously, it's emotional for you.

96
00:06:05,562 --> 00:06:08,466
It's very emotional. I feel
like I'm being kicked out.

97
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:11,595
Kicked out of my own home.

98
00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:13,961
Well, hopefully we'll get
some answers for you,

99
00:06:13,962 --> 00:06:16,266
and you won't have to leave, okay?

100
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:18,187
Okay.

101
00:06:20,377 --> 00:06:22,897
He is ticked.

102
00:06:23,741 --> 00:06:27,277
He's pissed off, and he won't talk to me
because I won't let him inside my body.

103
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:29,198
Okay.

104
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,814
So, do you know who he is?

105
00:06:31,815 --> 00:06:35,684
I think he's the guy who lived here.

106
00:06:35,685 --> 00:06:37,954
I mean, he, like, owned the
property or something...

107
00:06:37,955 --> 00:06:40,757
The guy from my opening.

108
00:06:40,758 --> 00:06:43,338
Where are you?

109
00:06:44,161 --> 00:06:48,390
It took me years to learn how to
keep the dead from entering my body.

110
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:50,552
But this man has figured out a way in.

111
00:06:50,553 --> 00:06:55,413
And now that I kicked
him out, he's furious.

112
00:06:56,974 --> 00:06:58,775
Oh, God.

113
00:06:58,776 --> 00:07:00,543
Oh, my head. My head hurts.

114
00:07:00,544 --> 00:07:02,079
This is really weird.

115
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,980
It's almost like if somebody took
your jaw and just ripped it off.

116
00:07:11,922 --> 00:07:14,082
Oh, God.

117
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,319
This is the area of the house where
most of the activity occurs.

118
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,755
Okay. Like what?

119
00:07:21,756 --> 00:07:24,768
Lights coming on constantly.

120
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:28,405
I literally saw the
bathroom light switch on.

121
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,206
And nobody was in the bathroom, I assume?

122
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:34,010
No, I got up and checked it out and
said, "anyone in the bathroom?"

123
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:35,178
And there was nobody there.

124
00:07:35,179 --> 00:07:37,180
Okay, so you saw the light go on?

125
00:07:37,181 --> 00:07:39,549
Something manually flips that switch.

126
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,552
Okay. That's strange.

127
00:07:42,553 --> 00:07:44,854
What do you know about the
house or the area itself?

128
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:46,189
Do you have any history here?

129
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,026
The first documentation
that I see is from 1892.

130
00:07:50,027 --> 00:07:52,061
Okay. So this house is old.

131
00:07:52,062 --> 00:07:54,230
Any deaths in the area?

132
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:57,549
I do know that there is a town legend

133
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,218
that people have talked
about since I was a kid.

134
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:01,284
What is it?

135
00:08:01,285 --> 00:08:06,108
Her name is Minnie Quay, and in the
late 1800s, she committed suicide.

136
00:08:06,109 --> 00:08:12,009
She's actually buried in the local cemetery
that's just not too far from here.

137
00:08:18,609 --> 00:08:22,449
So, there's a girl right there.

138
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:30,122
She's wearing, like, a yellow
dress, and she has long hair.

139
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:32,883
She's not happy.

140
00:08:36,374 --> 00:08:39,283
She's really wild, especially
for her time, you know?

141
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:43,311
And I think she got in trouble a lot.

142
00:08:43,312 --> 00:08:44,631
She...

143
00:08:44,632 --> 00:08:47,092
Is an issue.

144
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:50,107
She's an issue.

145
00:08:51,987 --> 00:08:53,907
Yeah.

146
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,629
She's so hyper, I can't understand
a word she's [Bleep] saying.

147
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,561
She's like, "alalala," like right here.

148
00:09:01,562 --> 00:09:03,332
Lalalalalala, pa-pa-pa...

149
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,167
Talking so fast, I can't understand her.

150
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:07,927
I'm, like, asking her to calm down.

151
00:09:07,928 --> 00:09:11,602
She needs to calm it down, calm it down.

152
00:09:11,603 --> 00:09:14,123
Calm it down.

153
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:25,498
We've had a few experiences upstairs
that were pretty frightening.

154
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:27,813
My husband and I were in bed one night,

155
00:09:27,814 --> 00:09:30,360
and we heard footsteps
coming up the stairs.

156
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,178
And I got up out of bed, and I
looked at the top of the stairs,

157
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:36,520
expecting, really, to see
somebody on the stairway...

158
00:09:36,521 --> 00:09:39,038
And nobody was there.

159
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,557
As we were walking down the steps,

160
00:09:40,558 --> 00:09:43,840
we realized at that point
that we were following it.

161
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:45,386
Now, the kids were downstairs?

162
00:09:45,387 --> 00:09:47,034
Yes, they were sleeping in their beds.

163
00:09:47,035 --> 00:09:50,513
Okay, so, besides the footsteps, have
you experienced anything else up here?

164
00:09:50,514 --> 00:09:53,215
Yeah. One day, I walked into the
house through the back door,

165
00:09:53,216 --> 00:09:57,176
and I heard a door slam upstairs.

166
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:03,059
It slammed so hard that literally
the foundation of the house shook.

167
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,528
Wow. Now, was anybody upstairs?

168
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:07,495
- No.
- All right.

169
00:10:07,496 --> 00:10:10,615
Well, Chrystal, I don't know what
Amy's gonna see on her walk.

170
00:10:10,616 --> 00:10:12,118
She could turn around and tell you...

171
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:14,737
"Listen, you can't stay here,
you got to get out of here".

172
00:10:14,738 --> 00:10:16,962
You got to be prepared for that.

173
00:10:16,963 --> 00:10:20,790
It's my mother's dream to make
this place a bed-and-breakfast,

174
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:24,991
and I want to continue on with that.

175
00:10:28,752 --> 00:10:32,052
She likes to play games.

176
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,691
Oh, kay.

177
00:10:36,398 --> 00:10:39,853
In my opening, I saw this
hallway, and all the doors were,

178
00:10:39,854 --> 00:10:44,054
opening and closing at the same time.

179
00:10:44,902 --> 00:10:47,656
This has to do with the girl.

180
00:10:47,657 --> 00:10:50,881
Do you know, like, why she does that?

181
00:10:50,882 --> 00:10:54,100
She likes to mess around.

182
00:10:54,101 --> 00:10:56,151
She's [Bleep] nuts.

183
00:10:56,152 --> 00:10:59,332
She's totally lost it.

184
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,755
So, Brittany, I was talking to your mom,
and she was explaining what's going

185
00:11:26,756 --> 00:11:30,094
on in the house and how it's affecting
her and practically the whole family.

186
00:11:30,095 --> 00:11:32,044
So what about yourself?

187
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:36,156
I just wake up in the middle of the night
sometimes, I feel like I'm being watched.

188
00:11:36,157 --> 00:11:38,482
I get an eerie feeling.

189
00:11:38,483 --> 00:11:41,668
So, what do you think is watching you?

190
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:45,886
I have seen a tall, black shadowy person.

191
00:11:45,887 --> 00:11:47,574
- Okay.
- And I never see its face.

192
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:51,235
It's just like a black blob.

193
00:11:55,964 --> 00:11:59,411
I feel bad in this room. I don't like it.

194
00:11:59,412 --> 00:12:01,635
I feel dark.

195
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:05,776
Like, corners are really, really bad.

196
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:13,198
So, there's two of these very tall, dark...

197
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,799
Solid, perfectly round things.

198
00:12:20,344 --> 00:12:24,024
Do you know if they can
interact with anybody living?

199
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:27,145
I feel like they can.

200
00:12:29,864 --> 00:12:32,465
And they can reach.

201
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:36,306
They're trying to get something.

202
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,751
So, Brittany, why did you bring me
in the kitchen? What's going on?

203
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:54,035
I was standing right here, and I
actually saw the shadowy figure,

204
00:12:54,036 --> 00:12:57,524
standing right there in the doorway.

205
00:12:57,525 --> 00:13:02,342
Almost like it was watching us and
listening to our conversation.

206
00:13:02,343 --> 00:13:07,729
It was really tall, skinnier,
but it resembles like a man.

207
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,188
Is it something you can see through?

208
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:12,969
No. It's a black, dark shadow.

209
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:23,071
I'm getting two things.

210
00:13:23,072 --> 00:13:24,953
They're together.

211
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:29,806
- What do you mean?
- They have some relationship here.

212
00:13:29,807 --> 00:13:32,541
And it's a male and a female.

213
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:36,142
This is male. That's female.

214
00:13:36,218 --> 00:13:39,698
That's angry. This is sad.

215
00:13:41,364 --> 00:13:43,232
I think these black masses
are the beginnings,

216
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:45,365
of a psychokinetic manifestation.

217
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,889
I can't tell where they came from,

218
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,808
but they're powerful and can
affect people in this house.

219
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:52,277
Especially whoever sleeps in that room.

220
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:55,814
This one makes you hurt inside.

221
00:13:55,815 --> 00:13:56,909
Like how?

222
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,350
Like lots of nervous energy here, like...

223
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,592
Or your heart's beating, and your head's
dizzy, and you're kind of nauseous,

224
00:14:07,593 --> 00:14:12,153
and you feel like you're gonna fall over.

225
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:15,656
I'm physically being affected here.

226
00:14:15,657 --> 00:14:21,417
I got chills just on my leg,
like there's something here.

227
00:14:24,643 --> 00:14:27,403
This isn't good.

228
00:14:35,254 --> 00:14:37,503
So, Mike, I was talking to
your wife, Chrystal, and

229
00:14:37,504 --> 00:14:39,803
she's pretty upset about the
stuff that's happening here.

230
00:14:39,804 --> 00:14:42,987
Now, is there any place specific in the
house where you've experienced anything?

231
00:14:42,988 --> 00:14:48,088
I have actually seen a
shadow in my dining room.

232
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:51,439
I was standing in the
doorway of my kitchen.

233
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,036
All of a sudden, I see this
big, black, massive shadow.

234
00:14:55,037 --> 00:14:57,701
Just go right across my dining-room wall.

235
00:14:57,702 --> 00:14:59,842
And it freaked me out a little bit.

236
00:14:59,843 --> 00:15:01,184
Well, describe it to me.

237
00:15:01,185 --> 00:15:03,936
So, it was like... about this wide.

238
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,501
It was like a mass.

239
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:08,653
It took up the whole length of the
ceiling, which we've got 9-foot ceilings,

240
00:15:08,654 --> 00:15:12,374
so I know it was pretty tall.

241
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,138
Wow. I don't know what this is.

242
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:20,892
Like, all of a sudden, all of
the energy just went fwoop!

243
00:15:20,893 --> 00:15:24,313
And it's completely still.

244
00:15:29,611 --> 00:15:32,371
Nobody's talking.

245
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,695
Getting chills up my back right here.

246
00:15:40,696 --> 00:15:43,996
It's like being touched.

247
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,235
It's really tall, and it bends over.

248
00:15:47,236 --> 00:15:50,176
It's really creepy.

249
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:56,508
It's like 9 feet tall.

250
00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:00,049
And it has to bend to see.

251
00:16:02,517 --> 00:16:04,465
I don't feel good in here.

252
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:08,006
I feel really sick in here.

253
00:16:08,056 --> 00:16:10,163
I don't like it.

254
00:16:10,164 --> 00:16:14,047
That's it. That's it. That's it.

255
00:16:14,048 --> 00:16:16,508
This is bad.

256
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,467
I'm gonna start my investigation

257
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:35,233
by following up on something
Chrystal told me about...

258
00:16:35,234 --> 00:16:39,816
The mysterious death of a
teenage girl named Minnie Quay.

259
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:41,650
I'm heading over to meet
with a local author,

260
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:43,812
who's been researching this case for years.

261
00:16:43,813 --> 00:16:49,393
I'm hoping she's got some
information to help my case.

262
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,438
Denise, the reason I called
you is my client mentioned,

263
00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:01,895
a legend about this girl, Minnie
Quay, that killed herself.

264
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,812
I need to find out from
you if it's true or not.

265
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:04,936
Oh, it's true.

266
00:17:04,937 --> 00:17:07,725
- It is?
- Minnie Quay did kill herself.

267
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,118
Now, when did this happen?

268
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,520
This happened on April 27th, 1876.

269
00:17:12,521 --> 00:17:13,562
Okay.

270
00:17:13,563 --> 00:17:17,223
Here is her death certificate.

271
00:17:18,224 --> 00:17:21,164
Suicide by drowning.

272
00:17:21,765 --> 00:17:23,185
So, what can you tell me about her?

273
00:17:23,186 --> 00:17:26,800
You know, Minnie was a 15-year-old
girl who was boy-crazy.

274
00:17:26,801 --> 00:17:29,136
She was a wild child of the time.

275
00:17:29,137 --> 00:17:31,754
But her parents were very strict.

276
00:17:31,755 --> 00:17:36,188
And so she was unable to do the
things that she wanted to do.

277
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:39,646
She fell in love with a sailor
off one of these ships,

278
00:17:39,647 --> 00:17:42,715
and she would secretly meet him.

279
00:17:42,716 --> 00:17:44,975
Uh, they pledged their love to each other.

280
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:47,669
Maybe they were formally engaged.

281
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,381
And her parents found out.

282
00:17:50,382 --> 00:17:53,961
And they forbade her to see this sailor.

283
00:17:53,962 --> 00:17:59,862
And she defied them and tried to see
him, and they locked her in her room.

284
00:18:07,376 --> 00:18:10,722
I'm getting a really weird pain.

285
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:13,098
This is from someone else.

286
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:15,319
Mm, damn.

287
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,521
Wow.

288
00:18:19,622 --> 00:18:22,790
Pain behind my ears, on either side...

289
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,216
Really, really intense.

290
00:18:25,217 --> 00:18:28,517
The girl who slams doors upstairs
is trying to get my attention.

291
00:18:28,518 --> 00:18:31,022
She finally has someone who can hear her.

292
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:34,298
And desperately wants to tell me her story.

293
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:37,805
She said her father was a bastard and um...

294
00:18:37,806 --> 00:18:41,826
I think she got in trouble a lot.

295
00:18:42,011 --> 00:18:45,380
You know, she was kind of like the black
sheep of the family or something.

296
00:18:45,381 --> 00:18:48,630
She got married. She's
really, really young.

297
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:51,157
She didn't want anything
to do with anybody.

298
00:18:51,158 --> 00:18:53,468
She hated her father.

299
00:18:53,469 --> 00:18:57,729
I don't think he cared for her much.

300
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:04,270
And then I'm getting a pain on my head.

301
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:10,967
I'm feeling, like, this pain
in my head that's like crazy.

302
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:14,588
So, what exactly happened after
her parents let her out?

303
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:17,624
When the shipping season
reopened again in April,

304
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:22,506
she found out that his ship had
foundered, and he was lost at sea.

305
00:19:22,507 --> 00:19:24,130
She was devastated.

306
00:19:24,131 --> 00:19:30,031
And so, on April 27th, eyewitnesses said
that she walked through Main Street.

307
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:35,315
- Okay.
- And walked down the length of the pier...

308
00:19:35,316 --> 00:19:40,656
And jumped into the frigid,
icy water of Lake Huron.

309
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:46,929
Now, are we talking about
the pier a few hundred

310
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,907
- yards from the house I'm investigating?
- Correct.

311
00:19:49,908 --> 00:19:53,494
The water was probably only 38
to 40 degrees at that time.

312
00:19:53,495 --> 00:19:54,695
She wouldn't have lasted long.

313
00:19:54,696 --> 00:19:56,713
She would not have lasted long.

314
00:19:56,714 --> 00:19:58,632
It's painful to jump in icy water.

315
00:19:58,633 --> 00:20:02,236
She would have gasped,
maybe inhaled water...

316
00:20:02,237 --> 00:20:04,940
And once the core temperature
begins to drop...

317
00:20:04,941 --> 00:20:07,241
- Right.
- The systems begin to fail.

318
00:20:07,242 --> 00:20:09,550
Okay. So, was her body recovered?

319
00:20:09,551 --> 00:20:12,579
It was recovered. They did
it by using grappling hooks.

320
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,648
Oh, I've seen that before.

321
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:15,849
It's very gruesome.

322
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:19,713
They could hook into the
neck, the torso, the face.

323
00:20:19,714 --> 00:20:22,103
I actually seen a guy one time
get caught under the chin,

324
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:25,123
and that's how they were able to pull
him out of the water. It's pretty sad.

325
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:27,464
It is sad.

326
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:33,522
I'm just hearing this woman.
There's a woman crying.

327
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,403
It's just a girl.

328
00:20:36,661 --> 00:20:39,541
It's just a girl.

329
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:44,123
I'm walking away from the
house and across the street.

330
00:20:44,124 --> 00:20:47,047
Right away I can see something
traumatic happened here.

331
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:51,662
And I'm seeing the residual
energy play out in front of me.

332
00:20:51,663 --> 00:20:57,563
The girl who's sad is lost, and
then a woman's looking for her.

333
00:21:00,862 --> 00:21:03,097
Yelling, yelling, yelling for her.

334
00:21:03,098 --> 00:21:06,578
Lots of people are yelling.

335
00:21:07,853 --> 00:21:10,155
I can't uh...

336
00:21:10,156 --> 00:21:12,633
I can't uh...

337
00:21:12,634 --> 00:21:13,495
Reach it.

338
00:21:13,496 --> 00:21:16,136
I can't, uh...

339
00:21:16,546 --> 00:21:18,646
Breathe.

340
00:21:19,347 --> 00:21:22,407
I think she's dying.

341
00:21:37,925 --> 00:21:41,895
Since this is such a small town and
everything's so close together.

342
00:21:41,896 --> 00:21:46,866
Minnie Quay's suicide might not have been
the only death near Chrystal's property.

343
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:49,068
So I'm heading over to meet
with a local historian

344
00:21:49,069 --> 00:21:54,969
who tells me Forester has a very
colorful and tragic history.

345
00:22:00,414 --> 00:22:03,417
T.J., you mentioned that
Forester had a dark past.

346
00:22:03,418 --> 00:22:04,650
Yeah.

347
00:22:04,651 --> 00:22:09,155
In 1871, you get a massive fire that
starts over on the West Side of the state,

348
00:22:09,156 --> 00:22:10,824
and it never really ends.

349
00:22:10,825 --> 00:22:14,027
It just keeps kind of hopscotching
its way across the state.

350
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:16,129
Hundreds upon hundreds of people die.

351
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,792
In Forester, there are stories of
people jumping into their wells,

352
00:22:19,793 --> 00:22:21,889
people that literally, you
know, walked into the

353
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,797
lake because there was no place else to go.

354
00:22:23,798 --> 00:22:25,171
It was just a ball of flame.

355
00:22:25,172 --> 00:22:27,131
How bad was the fire? What got destroyed?

356
00:22:27,132 --> 00:22:29,943
The '71 fire pretty much
devastated the entire community.

357
00:22:29,944 --> 00:22:31,654
Did they rebuild?

358
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:34,780
They did, but the fire of '81

359
00:22:34,781 --> 00:22:37,270
kind of spelled the doom
a second time around.

360
00:22:37,271 --> 00:22:39,812
While it didn't devastate it
as much as it did in '71,

361
00:22:39,813 --> 00:22:42,736
it still damaged the town pretty badly.

362
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:45,621
Oh, geez. Look at this. Wow.

363
00:22:45,622 --> 00:22:47,190
So, what happened to these people?

364
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:51,594
A lot of them just left, and
Forester never truly recovered.

365
00:22:51,595 --> 00:22:53,169
Well, a lot of tragedy.

366
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,426
You weren't kidding when you
said it had a dark past.

367
00:22:55,427 --> 00:22:57,347
Yeah.

368
00:23:07,544 --> 00:23:10,580
Something happened, and
everybody went away.

369
00:23:10,581 --> 00:23:14,852
But this was not attached to the house.

370
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:17,553
This is outside.

371
00:23:19,777 --> 00:23:24,157
I just see people yelling and screaming.

372
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:30,310
Like, I see this one woman, and she's
laying there, and she's in blood.

373
00:23:30,587 --> 00:23:34,967
And I do see a little boy who's dead.

374
00:23:35,493 --> 00:23:39,093
Probably like 15 to 20 died.

375
00:23:46,816 --> 00:23:52,716
The two fires that swept through Forester
in the late 1800s were a definite tragedy.

376
00:23:52,847 --> 00:23:57,952
So I'm at the library to find out who
owned Chrystal's land around that time.

377
00:23:57,953 --> 00:24:00,008
While looking through the
town's property records,

378
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:03,490
I came across the name Harrison Cooper.

379
00:24:03,491 --> 00:24:05,692
He not only owned the land back then

380
00:24:05,693 --> 00:24:10,286
but had some strange debts
associated with his name.

381
00:24:10,287 --> 00:24:13,514
I need to find out more
about the Cooper family.

382
00:24:13,515 --> 00:24:16,003
I'm on my way to meet
with a local genealogist.

383
00:24:16,004 --> 00:24:21,904
Who promised to tell me a lot more
about this family's dark past.

384
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,684
I came across the name Harrison Cooper.

385
00:24:30,685 --> 00:24:33,294
And I know he lived in the
property I'm investigating.

386
00:24:33,295 --> 00:24:34,600
What can you tell me about him?

387
00:24:34,601 --> 00:24:36,490
Well, before he lived in that property,

388
00:24:36,491 --> 00:24:40,428
he had purchased 56 acres
of land, kind of adjacent.

389
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:44,531
He lived there with his wife,
Elizabeth, and they had a daughter.

390
00:24:44,532 --> 00:24:46,367
- Her name was Emma Jay.
- Okay.

391
00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:50,404
And then the fire of 1881
wiped out everything.

392
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:53,140
So, how did this fire affect the coopers?

393
00:24:53,141 --> 00:24:55,834
At that time, Elizabeth was pregnant.

394
00:24:55,835 --> 00:24:58,124
She gave birth to a little boy.

395
00:24:58,125 --> 00:24:59,154
Okay.

396
00:24:59,155 --> 00:25:03,223
A week after that, Elizabeth
had a heart attack and died.

397
00:25:03,224 --> 00:25:08,367
So now, Harrison is left with his
daughter, Emma Jay, and a baby.

398
00:25:08,368 --> 00:25:12,292
Six weeks later, the baby
died because of malnutrition.

399
00:25:12,293 --> 00:25:13,876
Oh, geez.

400
00:25:13,877 --> 00:25:15,890
Now, how does he move on? What happened?

401
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:18,578
The next year, he married
his Sister-in-law.

402
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:23,006
And in 1894, he purchased the
property that you're investigating.

403
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:25,891
His daughter Emma and her
husband lived with them.

404
00:25:25,892 --> 00:25:29,848
Then, in 1903, another tragedy struck.

405
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:32,628
Emma gave birth, but the
baby was stillborn.

406
00:25:32,629 --> 00:25:34,700
- Now loses a grandchild.
- Yes.

407
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:37,699
Here's a copy of the death certificate.

408
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,333
What did they do with the body?

409
00:25:39,334 --> 00:25:45,234
Back in those days, they would have
buried the body on the property.

410
00:25:54,164 --> 00:25:55,554
There's a woman crying.

411
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:58,790
Real, real, like, sobbing.

412
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:00,192
She's sobbing.

413
00:26:00,193 --> 00:26:05,053
And then somebody says,
"well, the baby died".

414
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:07,932
It's horrible.

415
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,102
She's holding the dead baby.

416
00:26:10,103 --> 00:26:14,639
She's, like, petting it or
something, it looks like.

417
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,441
And then she's got blood
all over her dress.

418
00:26:18,442 --> 00:26:21,742
This lady, she's fading.

419
00:26:23,998 --> 00:26:26,614
But she doesn't want to
fade away she actually,

420
00:26:26,615 --> 00:26:30,822
doesn't want to because she likes
to be around those memories.

421
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:33,158
Even though they're bad.

422
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:36,346
So she's trying to hold on.

423
00:26:36,347 --> 00:26:39,827
She doesn't want to leave.

424
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:50,368
During my walk, I saw two black
masses in the upstairs bedroom,

425
00:26:50,369 --> 00:26:53,903
that felt so threatening I
had to try and sketch them.

426
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:56,380
It's these two...

427
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,682
Round, black...

428
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,723
Things.

429
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:04,561
They're looking at whoever's on the bed.

430
00:27:04,562 --> 00:27:07,425
And they're on each side of the room.

431
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:10,428
How close would you say it came to the bed?

432
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:12,325
Okay.

433
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:16,646
This one is coming out of the dresser.

434
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:26,468
Amy, is that about right?

435
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:30,207
Yes.

436
00:27:56,854 --> 00:27:59,206
Amy, this is Chrystal,

437
00:27:59,207 --> 00:28:02,392
Brittany, their daughter,
and Mike, her husband.

438
00:28:02,393 --> 00:28:04,439
Chrystal inherited this
house from her parents,

439
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,897
who sadly passed away a few years back.

440
00:28:06,898 --> 00:28:10,734
And Chrystal's mom had a dream of turning
this place into a bed-and-breakfast,

441
00:28:10,735 --> 00:28:12,002
and she'd like to do the same.

442
00:28:12,003 --> 00:28:15,306
But since they moved in
about a year or so ago,

443
00:28:15,307 --> 00:28:17,541
they've been going through
some horrific things.

444
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:20,138
They're actually scared to be here.

445
00:28:20,139 --> 00:28:21,716
Leaving here is not an option.

446
00:28:21,717 --> 00:28:24,416
So, with that being said, what I'll
do is I'll turn it over to Amy,

447
00:28:24,417 --> 00:28:29,217
and she can start telling
us about her walk.

448
00:28:31,556 --> 00:28:35,592
I saw that something bad happened outside.

449
00:28:35,593 --> 00:28:39,741
And I heard people screaming and yelling.

450
00:28:39,742 --> 00:28:45,642
And then I saw like 15 to 20 bodies just
kind of scattered around on the ground.

451
00:28:46,118 --> 00:28:48,536
One of them was a child.

452
00:28:48,537 --> 00:28:53,119
Like, I see this one woman, and she's
laying there, and she's in blood.

453
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,500
And I do see a little boy who's dead.

454
00:28:58,771 --> 00:29:02,490
Back in 1871, there was a
huge fire here that killed

455
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,896
a few hundred people, and
there were bodies everywhere.

456
00:29:04,897 --> 00:29:07,718
- So, hundreds of people died?
- Yeah.

457
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:12,356
Then again, in 1881, another
fire just wiped everything out.

458
00:29:12,357 --> 00:29:14,908
It actually destroyed
about 56 acres of land

459
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:17,938
that was owned by this guy Harrison Cooper.

460
00:29:17,939 --> 00:29:20,193
The interesting thing
about Harrison Cooper,

461
00:29:20,194 --> 00:29:25,170
his wife was pregnant during
the time of the fire.

462
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:29,758
She gave birth within a few days
after the fire to a baby boy.

463
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:33,383
She dies of a heart attack
a couple days after that.

464
00:29:33,384 --> 00:29:36,903
Unfortunately, six weeks
later, the baby died.

465
00:29:36,904 --> 00:29:39,424
- Wow.
- Wow.

466
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:45,227
I'm doing my opening and...

467
00:29:45,228 --> 00:29:49,450
There's this man that came into my body.

468
00:29:49,451 --> 00:29:55,034
And so, I'm seeing things through
his eyes, because we meshed.

469
00:29:55,035 --> 00:29:58,907
He wanted to do the whole walk like that.

470
00:29:58,908 --> 00:30:02,015
So that he would be talking through me.

471
00:30:02,016 --> 00:30:04,291
Well, that's really dangerous.

472
00:30:04,292 --> 00:30:06,264
I kicked him out, and...

473
00:30:06,265 --> 00:30:07,614
What did he look like?

474
00:30:07,615 --> 00:30:10,615
He was a big guy...

475
00:30:11,073 --> 00:30:12,464
Very husky.

476
00:30:12,465 --> 00:30:13,727
Why did you ask her that?

477
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:17,088
Because I've seen a man.

478
00:30:17,792 --> 00:30:19,338
It's a dark shadow.

479
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:22,339
- Is he big?
- Yep.

480
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,800
- Are you okay?
- Yeah? All right.

481
00:30:32,058 --> 00:30:34,074
- Is he dangerous?
- Yes.

482
00:30:34,075 --> 00:30:35,476
Say, you're sleeping.

483
00:30:35,477 --> 00:30:40,150
The distinction between reality
and dreams can get blurred.

484
00:30:40,151 --> 00:30:42,032
She's having nightmares.

485
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:44,218
- I do.
- Okay.

486
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:46,654
Does he come and go, or
is he here all the time?

487
00:30:46,655 --> 00:30:49,315
It seems like he's here all the time.

488
00:30:49,316 --> 00:30:50,690
Does he watch us?

489
00:30:50,691 --> 00:30:52,059
Well, yeah.

490
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,526
Well, I feel like I'm being
watched, that's why I asked.

491
00:30:54,527 --> 00:30:57,262
- Where?
- In my upstairs bedroom.

492
00:30:57,263 --> 00:31:00,143
And in the hallway.

493
00:31:00,144 --> 00:31:04,044
This is kind of freaking me out.

494
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,978
Okay. So, what else did you see?

495
00:31:05,979 --> 00:31:09,209
When I went upstairs, I
heard this woman sobbing...

496
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,037
Really crying, like, hard.

497
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:13,877
Like from her stomach, you know?

498
00:31:13,878 --> 00:31:18,401
I heard someone say, "well, the baby died".

499
00:31:18,402 --> 00:31:20,776
I saw blood all over her.

500
00:31:20,777 --> 00:31:22,667
And then she was holding the baby

501
00:31:22,668 --> 00:31:25,340
- and, like, petting it in a weird way.
- Ah, geez.

502
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:28,521
And the baby was dead.

503
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:33,321
A lot of things that happened here
were very disturbing for her.

504
00:31:33,322 --> 00:31:35,571
Well, that makes sense to me then.

505
00:31:35,572 --> 00:31:37,312
The guy Harrison Cooper
I was talking about?

506
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:40,295
When he moved to this property,
his daughter Emma Jay,

507
00:31:40,296 --> 00:31:42,230
she was living here with her husband.

508
00:31:42,231 --> 00:31:45,283
She wound up having a stillborn baby here.

509
00:31:45,284 --> 00:31:49,694
Matter of fact, it was in 1903, but they
still had a death certificate for her.

510
00:31:49,695 --> 00:31:54,919
What I was told, the baby's
probably buried on the property.

511
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,898
So you're saying you think that it's Emma?

512
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:01,079
It would seem like it.

513
00:32:01,414 --> 00:32:03,581
Okay. What else did you see?

514
00:32:03,582 --> 00:32:07,586
I went back outside and
went across the street.

515
00:32:07,587 --> 00:32:12,652
And we're walking down there, and all of a
sudden, I felt really, really, really sad.

516
00:32:12,653 --> 00:32:15,743
Like somebody had just died.

517
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:21,644
I'm feeling this girl, and I'm hearing
this woman calling for this girl.

518
00:32:22,262 --> 00:32:25,689
"Where are you? Where are you?"

519
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,211
Who does that sound like?

520
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:28,862
Yeah. Minnie Quay.

521
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:29,866
Huh?

522
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:31,669
It was a town legend
that she killed herself,

523
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:34,004
she was 15 years old, she
threw herself in the river.

524
00:32:34,005 --> 00:32:37,169
Right over here by the dock.

525
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:39,358
Because she was in a relationship with a...

526
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,000
- Merchant sailor.
- Oh, man.

527
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:45,222
So, he was out to sea, and
word got back that he died.

528
00:32:45,223 --> 00:32:47,123
- His ship went down.
- Oh, no.

529
00:32:47,124 --> 00:32:49,759
She walked down the block from her house,

530
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,627
walked up to the lake,
and then she jumped in.

531
00:32:53,628 --> 00:32:57,733
So, the men used grappling hooks
to get her out of the water.

532
00:32:57,734 --> 00:33:01,581
This has been told to
us since we were kids.

533
00:33:01,582 --> 00:33:03,817
So, this is more than a town legend?

534
00:33:03,818 --> 00:33:04,918
Yeah.

535
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:09,239
The girl you say that's here, could
that be Minnie Quay, the same girl?

536
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,628
I think it very well could be.

537
00:33:11,629 --> 00:33:15,208
She might be going between
different locations all the time.

538
00:33:15,209 --> 00:33:19,348
It could be more than just this house.

539
00:33:19,349 --> 00:33:25,249
So, the next person that I met when I
came back into the house was a girl.

540
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:28,423
And she was kind of wild
and crazy for her time.

541
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:32,390
And she was very much the
black sheep of the family.

542
00:33:32,391 --> 00:33:36,856
It's interesting you're saying that because
it kind of sounds like Minnie Quay.

543
00:33:36,857 --> 00:33:39,726
She kind of told everybody that
her and this guy were engaged.

544
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:42,366
There's no records for it because
everything burned in the fire,

545
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:45,366
but the father was very strict, he
thought this sailor was beneath her.

546
00:33:45,367 --> 00:33:47,039
And he locked her up...

547
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,614
I mean, physically locked her up in her
room so she couldn't get out to see him.

548
00:33:50,615 --> 00:33:52,612
She was very physical...

549
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:55,377
Capable of having physical interaction.

550
00:33:55,378 --> 00:33:57,831
She is very bored.

551
00:33:57,832 --> 00:34:01,688
And she likes to get
reactions for her behaviors.

552
00:34:01,689 --> 00:34:04,331
Does she move things?

553
00:34:04,332 --> 00:34:07,272
She's capable, yes.

554
00:34:07,361 --> 00:34:10,830
I came in one time, and I walked
back into the dining room,

555
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:15,668
and the door slammed upstairs
so hard the whole house shook.

556
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:17,570
- Wow.
- The foundation shook.

557
00:34:17,571 --> 00:34:19,821
Oh, my gosh.

558
00:34:19,822 --> 00:34:22,462
It's the girl.

559
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,145
So, what else did you see then?

560
00:34:26,146 --> 00:34:27,875
So...

561
00:34:27,876 --> 00:34:31,356
This part was uncomfortable.

562
00:34:32,157 --> 00:34:37,768
So, I went into a room with a pink bed,
and I did not feel good in there at all.

563
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:42,901
I got really, really bad chills,
like in different parts of my body.

564
00:34:42,902 --> 00:34:48,802
Then I'm looking, and I see these two
dark things in each corner of the room.

565
00:34:51,042 --> 00:34:55,587
They're very tall, and I
felt like they were trying

566
00:34:55,588 --> 00:34:59,248
to reach something or someone.

567
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:02,956
Because they're coming in towards the bed.

568
00:35:02,957 --> 00:35:07,397
And they are just sitting there watching.

569
00:35:07,704 --> 00:35:11,124
They're very, very creepy.

570
00:35:22,351 --> 00:35:24,631
I see it.

571
00:35:37,893 --> 00:35:43,533
I see these two dark things
in each corner of the room.

572
00:35:44,547 --> 00:35:49,238
They're very tall, and I
felt like they were trying

573
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:52,899
to reach something or someone.

574
00:35:53,015 --> 00:35:56,578
Because they're coming in towards the bed.

575
00:35:56,579 --> 00:36:01,019
And they are just sitting there watching.

576
00:36:09,371 --> 00:36:11,651
I see it.

577
00:36:14,587 --> 00:36:19,807
I've seen it watch me and
my mom in the doorway.

578
00:36:28,662 --> 00:36:32,622
And I feel it watch me at night.

579
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:36,258
And I can't sleep.

580
00:36:36,888 --> 00:36:39,356
I wake up in the middle of the night.

581
00:36:39,357 --> 00:36:42,893
I don't even want to get out
of bed because it scares me.

582
00:36:42,894 --> 00:36:46,374
I feel like they watch me.

583
00:36:46,397 --> 00:36:48,365
I've seen it.

584
00:36:48,366 --> 00:36:54,066
It's tall, and it's black,
and I can't see through it.

585
00:36:59,238 --> 00:37:03,498
I did sketch what I saw in her room.

586
00:37:04,116 --> 00:37:07,296
It looks a little odd.

587
00:37:16,971 --> 00:37:19,251
Oh, Jesus.

588
00:37:19,574 --> 00:37:21,554
Now...

589
00:37:21,901 --> 00:37:27,421
Does this look similar to
what you saw in the doorway?

590
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:33,530
Yeah. I can't see a face.

591
00:37:33,732 --> 00:37:39,552
These things can make you feel
sick and dizzy and nauseous.

592
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,696
And this one is sadness.

593
00:37:42,697 --> 00:37:46,089
This one makes you hurt inside.

594
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:48,912
Or your heart's beating,
and your head's dizzy.

595
00:37:48,913 --> 00:37:51,164
This one's making us feel like that?

596
00:37:51,165 --> 00:37:52,403
Oh, yeah.

597
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:54,501
Yeah, it's very hard to
control your emotions here.

598
00:37:54,502 --> 00:37:58,822
I feel like we're all over the place.

599
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:07,711
So, when you're seeing the dark
mass bopping around the house,

600
00:38:07,712 --> 00:38:12,932
I think that's the man
doing those things to you.

601
00:38:13,254 --> 00:38:17,206
The male who was trying to jump me...

602
00:38:17,207 --> 00:38:22,044
This is just a part of him,
that nasty emotional part.

603
00:38:22,045 --> 00:38:24,442
But then there's also this
separate conscious entity,

604
00:38:24,443 --> 00:38:26,949
that he is like, his own person.

605
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,714
The dead male?

606
00:38:28,715 --> 00:38:30,419
Maybe this Harrison?

607
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,473
- Harrison Cooper?
- Yes.

608
00:38:33,474 --> 00:38:37,559
And then this one is aspects of
the woman who lost the child.

609
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,629
- That's his daughter?
- Yes.

610
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,730
Okay.

611
00:38:40,731 --> 00:38:44,562
So, these are always in that room.

612
00:38:44,563 --> 00:38:49,663
And what they want to do
is, they want to grow.

613
00:38:49,676 --> 00:38:51,847
These dark masses are the very beginnings

614
00:38:51,848 --> 00:38:54,039
of psychokinetic manifestations.

615
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,208
Usually these are formed by the living,

616
00:38:56,209 --> 00:39:02,109
but in this case, it's the dead
here that have created them.

617
00:39:02,682 --> 00:39:06,518
Typically, it's affiliated
with living people.

618
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:09,054
But what I'm seeing is
that conscious dead people

619
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:13,364
are also creating these types of entities.

620
00:39:13,365 --> 00:39:16,990
It's because they're not dealing
with their emotions properly.

621
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:19,811
And it's growing.

622
00:39:19,923 --> 00:39:23,814
Like, it's actually kind of
forming a consciousness.

623
00:39:23,815 --> 00:39:25,364
What happens if they grow?

624
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:28,495
It would become its own entity.

625
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:31,084
That would be really, really bad.

626
00:39:31,085 --> 00:39:34,246
The problem is that they
can be very physical.

627
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:38,987
I mean, these guys can cause a lot of harm.

628
00:39:39,182 --> 00:39:43,080
They're reaching out, I
think, because of your age.

629
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:47,449
A lot of poltergeist hauntings
will be around teenagers.

630
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:50,175
And they'll be the conduit for it.

631
00:39:50,176 --> 00:39:53,699
These things feed off of the
living person's energy.

632
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,400
- Me, or my parents, too?
- Yeah.

633
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:57,261
You.

634
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,416
Now that you've seen the
results of the investigation,

635
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:14,942
you know why things have been going wrong
since you moved into your parents' house.

636
00:40:14,943 --> 00:40:19,725
The big question is, is it safe for you to
stay, and can you fulfill your mom's dream?

637
00:40:19,726 --> 00:40:24,346
With that, I have to turn it over to Amy.

638
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:30,002
Well, the first thing is
that you do need a medium.

639
00:40:30,003 --> 00:40:34,306
To come back and help to move Minnie on...

640
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:39,587
Not talk to her, not do
anything, just to move on.

641
00:40:40,346 --> 00:40:43,182
That medium, after doing that with her,

642
00:40:43,183 --> 00:40:47,552
needs to go up into your
room and go to the corner,

643
00:40:47,553 --> 00:40:51,923
then ask the male that's
here to receive this back...

644
00:40:51,924 --> 00:40:55,268
As part of him so he's whole.

645
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:57,836
And then she moves him on.

646
00:40:57,837 --> 00:41:00,065
Then she needs to deal with this.

647
00:41:00,066 --> 00:41:05,137
And what she needs to do there is
she needs to collect the energy.

648
00:41:05,138 --> 00:41:07,975
And then she needs to
take it out of the house.

649
00:41:07,976 --> 00:41:10,784
It's just funky emotional energy

650
00:41:10,785 --> 00:41:14,246
that needs to be contained
and removed from the house.

651
00:41:14,247 --> 00:41:18,147
And the medium needs to do that.

652
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,352
The other thing would be for you

653
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:22,683
to go ahead and sleep in
another area of the house.

654
00:41:22,684 --> 00:41:26,758
Because it would take quite some
time for these things to reroute.

655
00:41:26,759 --> 00:41:28,967
So if you're sleeping in
another area of the house,

656
00:41:28,968 --> 00:41:32,430
that would be much more beneficial for you.

657
00:41:32,431 --> 00:41:34,439
So, where are you sleeping tonight?

658
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,657
I don't know. Not in my room.

659
00:41:36,658 --> 00:41:38,170
- Okay.
- I won't sleep in there.

660
00:41:38,171 --> 00:41:41,623
I wouldn't sleep in your room right now.

661
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:42,647
No way.

662
00:41:42,648 --> 00:41:45,201
Bottom line, they get all this done...

663
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,204
Mm-hmm.

664
00:41:46,205 --> 00:41:48,400
Is Chrystal and her family
gonna be able to stay here

665
00:41:48,401 --> 00:41:50,348
and turn this place into
a bed-and-breakfast?

666
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:52,929
Possibly, yeah.

667
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:56,255
Now, you're gonna follow
Amy's advice, obviously.

668
00:41:56,256 --> 00:41:57,810
Oh, I'm gonna do it.

669
00:41:57,811 --> 00:42:01,711
And then we'll just continue on.

670
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:06,698
If Chrystal and her
family bring in a medium,

671
00:42:06,699 --> 00:42:10,067
they should be able to get rid of
the poltergeist manifestations.

672
00:42:10,068 --> 00:42:14,954
And hopefully make their dream of
opening a bed-and-breakfast come true.
