1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:05,397 --> 00:00:08,133
He said that he'd kill me if I came here.

3
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:11,887
As I looked up, I saw a face
look out the window at me.

4
00:00:11,888 --> 00:00:15,039
This little kid becomes, like, the devil.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,547
You can see its head just...

6
00:00:18,548 --> 00:00:20,648
Hanging.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,683
He lets things in that are
really bad sometimes.

8
00:00:25,684 --> 00:00:28,163
And I'm very, very concerned
for the welfare of my son.

9
00:00:28,164 --> 00:00:30,928
Like, they could be standing right
next to us right now as we speak.

10
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:33,149
Oh, yeah.

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,163
They're being watched.

12
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:41,284
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:41,352 --> 00:00:43,868
This thing likes death.

14
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:45,386
I see dead people.

15
00:00:45,387 --> 00:00:46,983
This thing is, like, a monster.

16
00:00:46,984 --> 00:00:48,935
I speak to dead people...

17
00:00:48,936 --> 00:00:50,673
And he's pissed off now.

18
00:00:50,674 --> 00:00:52,038
And they speak to me.

19
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:53,745
His head was cracked.

20
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:57,048
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

21
00:00:57,049 --> 00:00:58,731
This guy was murdered.

22
00:00:58,732 --> 00:01:00,209
I rely on my partner.

23
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,671
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

24
00:01:01,672 --> 00:01:03,612
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

25
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:06,147
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

26
00:01:06,148 --> 00:01:09,451
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

27
00:01:09,452 --> 00:01:12,153
You saw her? It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:12,154 --> 00:01:13,487
Why would you stay here?

29
00:01:13,488 --> 00:01:15,437
But Steve and I never speak...

30
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:17,592
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:17,593 --> 00:01:19,060
Until the very end.

32
00:01:19,061 --> 00:01:20,796
Stop it. Stop it.

33
00:01:20,797 --> 00:01:22,764
We uncover if it's safe for you to stay...

34
00:01:22,765 --> 00:01:25,180
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

35
00:01:25,181 --> 00:01:26,468
Or time to get out.

36
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:31,149
I told you there were ghosts in this house.

37
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:58,059
Amy and I conduct our
investigations separately.

38
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,448
I interview witnesses and uncover
dark secrets from the past.

39
00:02:02,449 --> 00:02:05,645
While Amy communicates with the other side.

40
00:02:05,646 --> 00:02:10,986
At the end, we come together
to reveal our findings.

41
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,987
I'm in the small farming
town of Belvidere, Illinois.

42
00:02:18,988 --> 00:02:22,822
It's about an hour and a
half north of Chicago.

43
00:02:22,823 --> 00:02:25,837
We've been called in by a woman named Judy.

44
00:02:25,838 --> 00:02:27,672
She sounds hysterical.

45
00:02:27,673 --> 00:02:31,939
She says weird stuff is happening
and it's tearing her family apart.

46
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,927
She's afraid for her son and her dad.

47
00:02:34,928 --> 00:02:40,828
I'm hoping we can help her out,
because this one sounds bad.

48
00:02:50,052 --> 00:02:55,952
Before Amy arrives, I clear the
area of any leading information.

49
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,856
This location is not only
filled with pictures,

50
00:03:00,857 --> 00:03:04,833
but many unique items that
I have to cover or remove.

51
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:10,054
Once the house is cleared,
Amy can begin her walk.

52
00:03:33,163 --> 00:03:39,063
So there's, like, some really
significant stuff going on here.

53
00:03:41,373 --> 00:03:43,953
Right in here.

54
00:03:44,354 --> 00:03:47,301
There are, like, these things.

55
00:03:47,302 --> 00:03:50,067
And they're, like...

56
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:54,148
They're [Bleep ] creepy as [Bleep ].

57
00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:56,798
I saw one...

58
00:03:56,826 --> 00:04:00,186
Walking, um, in the yard.

59
00:04:00,222 --> 00:04:04,602
And it was, like, probably 7 feet tall.

60
00:04:06,428 --> 00:04:11,648
Huge, huge, and... and
they're just all over here.

61
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,652
Judy, you sounded really concerned
on the phone and upset.

62
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:33,059
- I mean, what's going on?
- Well, we're here at my dad's house.

63
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,748
About ten years ago, my
son and I moved in here,

64
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:39,977
and ever since we moved
in, we're experiencing...

65
00:04:39,978 --> 00:04:41,896
A lot on this property.

66
00:04:41,897 --> 00:04:43,682
So what kind of things are happening?

67
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:49,470
We've heard noises, we've seen apparitions,
and we've been physically touched.

68
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:53,325
As a concerned mom, I wanted to
get my son out of that situation,

69
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:58,364
so about three years ago, we moved
out of here about 10 miles away.

70
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,448
And it hasn't stopped.

71
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:03,971
Similar experiences are
happening to us over there,

72
00:05:03,972 --> 00:05:07,095
and I'm very, very concerned
for the welfare of my son.

73
00:05:07,096 --> 00:05:09,028
Well, Judy, let me ask you,
your father still lives here?

74
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:10,896
- He does.
- Okay, are you concerned about that?

75
00:05:10,897 --> 00:05:15,397
I am concerned about him and his welfare.

76
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:24,604
While I was opening, there was,
like, this little boy who was...

77
00:05:24,605 --> 00:05:26,987
Like, 5 or 6 years old maybe.

78
00:05:26,988 --> 00:05:31,182
And blond hair, and he
didn't have any eyes.

79
00:05:31,183 --> 00:05:36,403
He looks, like, Angelic,
but he's, uh, he's dark.

80
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,886
He just had this, like, really...

81
00:05:39,887 --> 00:05:43,367
Bad, bad feeling about him.

82
00:05:46,855 --> 00:05:51,835
What the [Bleep ] is
burrowing under the ground?

83
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:55,782
It's, like, some creepy...

84
00:05:55,783 --> 00:05:58,303
Thing. Like...

85
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:05,129
This is not good, and it has something
to do with the little boy and the...

86
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,050
Barn.

87
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:21,569
It feels weird, creepy being back in here.

88
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,490
Okay.

89
00:06:23,818 --> 00:06:26,621
So do me a favor why
don't you tell me about,

90
00:06:26,622 --> 00:06:28,981
some of the experiences you had
while you were living here?

91
00:06:28,982 --> 00:06:32,171
I've been brushed up against
the back of my legs.

92
00:06:32,172 --> 00:06:34,475
My shirt kind of tugged a little bit.

93
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:37,030
I've heard whistling.

94
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:39,030
My name called.

95
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,182
And my ear being tugged on.

96
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:44,413
Judy, how'd you wind up staying here
so long with all this going on?

97
00:06:44,414 --> 00:06:47,649
You know, Steve, I had to really try
to hold it together for my son.

98
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,850
Well, you're a tough woman.
I give you credit.

99
00:06:49,851 --> 00:06:52,371
I had to be.

100
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:05,063
There's, like, a lot of hatred there.

101
00:07:05,064 --> 00:07:07,884
With this child...

102
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,206
A lot of hatred.

103
00:07:10,207 --> 00:07:13,086
And, like, he... he... he can interact.
He does.

104
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:15,203
He can and he does.

105
00:07:15,204 --> 00:07:21,104
I don't really get what he's doing or why
a fricking 5-year-old kid would go crazy.

106
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:27,279
It's like this little kid
becomes, like, the devil.

107
00:07:36,274 --> 00:07:38,280
So, Judy, why are we here?

108
00:07:38,281 --> 00:07:41,658
Well, I had to feed the animals
for my dad who went out of town,

109
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:44,623
so my girlfriend came with
me, and as I looked up,

110
00:07:44,624 --> 00:07:47,868
I saw a face look out the window at me,

111
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:51,562
and I immediately turned around and
ran screaming towards the house.

112
00:07:51,563 --> 00:07:54,294
Okay, now can you describe him
for me as far as his features?

113
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:59,495
He had a round face, a big nose, and...
his eyes were dark.

114
00:07:59,496 --> 00:08:01,849
If you had to guess an
age, what would you say?

115
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,116
I would say mid-30s or 40s.

116
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:09,882
The feeling I had in my stomach, it
definitely wasn't anything human.

117
00:08:09,883 --> 00:08:13,903
- This was ghostly looking.
- Okay.

118
00:08:24,653 --> 00:08:26,711
So I hear this voice.

119
00:08:26,712 --> 00:08:31,812
It's really grumbly, like,
gravelly, like, hoarse.

120
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,790
He's like a... like a madman.

121
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:39,189
I don't know if he thinks
he's possessed, or...

122
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,951
Can you describe him more?

123
00:08:40,952 --> 00:08:43,571
He's probably in his, like, late 30s.

124
00:08:43,572 --> 00:08:46,212
Mm, he's thin.

125
00:08:47,062 --> 00:08:50,148
He's yelling at me. He's a...
very agitated.

126
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:53,941
- What is he yelling?
- Uh, to get out.

127
00:08:53,942 --> 00:08:58,622
He said that he'd kill me if I came here.

128
00:09:03,262 --> 00:09:06,262
He's like a madman.

129
00:09:06,294 --> 00:09:08,996
- He's yelling at me.
- What is he yelling?

130
00:09:08,997 --> 00:09:11,697
Uh, to get out.

131
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:15,632
He told me that he'd
kill me if I came here.

132
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:18,502
And I said, "oh, yeah? Bring it on".

133
00:09:18,503 --> 00:09:24,071
Now he's small and weak and
cowering, and, um, and he's crying.

134
00:09:24,072 --> 00:09:27,972
He's, like, sad, depressed, um...

135
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:40,956
Frankie, I was talking to
your mom earlier, and, uh,

136
00:09:40,957 --> 00:09:42,981
she basically told me you had
it rough growing up here.

137
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,119
Can you tell me about some
of the experiences you had?

138
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,416
There was one time I was
coming outside of the house,

139
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:51,541
and I looked up from the
porch at that window,

140
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:54,782
and I seen this figure,

141
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:00,071
moving back and forth, you know, trying to
hide, but at the same time watching us.

142
00:10:00,072 --> 00:10:04,072
- Can you describe the guy?
- It was a white outlined figure.

143
00:10:04,073 --> 00:10:07,043
- Did you ever see it again?
- Yes.

144
00:10:07,044 --> 00:10:12,944
A few months later, uh, I seen the same
figure up in the corner over there...

145
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,061
And its head was actually tilted down.

146
00:10:18,062 --> 00:10:23,141
I could see the rope around
its neck and its head just...

147
00:10:23,142 --> 00:10:24,772
Hanging to the side.

148
00:10:24,773 --> 00:10:27,268
So it looked like somebody that was hung.

149
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:29,189
Yeah.

150
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:36,450
This male, I guess he kind of
just lost his mind or something.

151
00:10:38,022 --> 00:10:41,354
My head hurts oh, so bad up here.

152
00:10:41,355 --> 00:10:46,338
Bad pain in my head. Bad,
bad pain in my head.

153
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:49,206
I'm feeling the agony
this man went through.

154
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:54,607
He is lost, confused, and
completely out of his mind.

155
00:10:56,986 --> 00:10:59,806
He killed himself.

156
00:11:04,513 --> 00:11:07,273
It happened here.

157
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:11,722
There's something with a rope.

158
00:11:20,005 --> 00:11:22,676
How old were you when
this was all going on?

159
00:11:22,677 --> 00:11:24,863
Around 9, 10 years old.

160
00:11:24,864 --> 00:11:28,621
- How were you sleeping at night?
- I wasn't really sleeping good at all.

161
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:32,784
For a few years straight,
I had the same dream.

162
00:11:32,785 --> 00:11:36,156
Of this man standing in
the yard watching me.

163
00:11:36,157 --> 00:11:37,666
Describe him to me.

164
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:41,164
He wasn't that tall, had a
mask on, regular pants.

165
00:11:41,165 --> 00:11:44,995
- What do you mean, had a mask on?
- It was a plain white mask.

166
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,192
Couldn't see his face, nothing.

167
00:11:47,193 --> 00:11:50,406
- How'd you deal with that?
- It bothered me as a kid a lot.

168
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:53,015
I felt like it was supposed to,
like, mean something to me,

169
00:11:53,016 --> 00:11:55,219
like I was supposed to
understand something.

170
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,084
But I still to this day don't understand.

171
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,005
Okay.

172
00:12:06,117 --> 00:12:09,741
Those things, they're just all over here.

173
00:12:09,742 --> 00:12:12,409
- What did it look like?
- Human-shaped.

174
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,617
Very broad...

175
00:12:14,618 --> 00:12:16,143
Big arms.

176
00:12:16,144 --> 00:12:17,709
Okay.

177
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:22,167
As I head back to the house, I have to
pass by the 7-foot-tall creatures again.

178
00:12:22,168 --> 00:12:26,861
I don't know why they're here, but
I know they're hiding something.

179
00:12:26,862 --> 00:12:28,916
Like, how many?

180
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:31,761
Six to ten, maybe.

181
00:12:31,762 --> 00:12:36,562
They were exchanging
masks, like, white masks.

182
00:12:37,536 --> 00:12:40,057
Do you think living people have seen these?

183
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:42,151
Definitely, I think they've,
like, seen 'em, and,

184
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:44,417
like, had, like, encounters with them.

185
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:47,517
And [Bleep ] freaked the [Bleep ] out.

186
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:51,058
Because they are very scary.

187
00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:00,018
Well, Franco, I spoke with your daughter.

188
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:03,165
She told me she was getting
physically touched.

189
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:06,423
Your grandson is pretty much traumatized
by everything that happened here.

190
00:13:06,424 --> 00:13:07,861
He's still traumatized.

191
00:13:07,862 --> 00:13:10,251
I was wondering if you ever
experienced anything here.

192
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:12,688
Oh, I sure did.

193
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:18,093
In the dining room, a figure
walked in, and he looked at me,

194
00:13:18,094 --> 00:13:22,101
and like he was surprised that I was here.

195
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:26,422
And this was a real tall, slender man.

196
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,578
He had this old jacket,
almost like a suit jacket,

197
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:33,695
but again, from way back when.

198
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:37,246
- Did you see anything else in this house?
- Just one other time.

199
00:13:37,247 --> 00:13:39,867
One night I was in here watching TV,

200
00:13:39,868 --> 00:13:44,832
and right to the right on the floor,
I see this little white cloud.

201
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:49,986
And then it started moving, and I could
see the shape of a head and little arms.

202
00:13:49,987 --> 00:13:50,985
You're kidding.

203
00:13:50,986 --> 00:13:56,683
Almost like a premature baby.
It was slowly moving around.

204
00:13:56,684 --> 00:13:58,544
Wow.

205
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,927
The little boy thing, whatever
the [Bleep ] it is...

206
00:14:07,928 --> 00:14:11,463
He likes really bad [Bleep ].

207
00:14:11,464 --> 00:14:16,504
He lets things in that are
really bad sometimes.

208
00:14:18,411 --> 00:14:23,751
But he seems too [Bleep ]
evil to be a 5-year-old.

209
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:29,509
Yeah, he's a liar. I
think he's tricking me.

210
00:14:31,355 --> 00:14:33,454
I think he's a liar.

211
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,755
I don't like him, okay?

212
00:14:45,214 --> 00:14:47,760
Yeah, that kind of scared me a little bit.

213
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,281
What happened?

214
00:14:51,472 --> 00:14:53,713
It's not a real kid.

215
00:14:53,714 --> 00:14:57,114
It's something really bad.

216
00:14:57,115 --> 00:14:58,430
Like what?

217
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:02,691
Demons will pretend to be dead people.

218
00:15:10,854 --> 00:15:12,416
What are you thinking?

219
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:15,897
That it's not a real kid.

220
00:15:18,014 --> 00:15:23,234
I think that the burrowing
monster is this child...

221
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:30,529
And I think that it'll torment
the people who are living here.

222
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:37,105
Do you know if, uh,
people here see this boy?

223
00:15:37,106 --> 00:15:43,006
I think so, but I don't think they
necessarily see him like I do.

224
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:51,188
Yeah, that kind of scared me a little bit.

225
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:54,270
So you're saying that he might
project himself differently to,

226
00:15:54,271 --> 00:15:57,559
different people to influence
their perception of him?

227
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,795
Yes.

228
00:15:58,796 --> 00:16:01,273
Do you know if they have
any kind of interaction?

229
00:16:01,274 --> 00:16:07,174
He makes them feel sick or he makes them
hurt or something along those lines.

230
00:16:07,311 --> 00:16:12,531
It feels like he can easily
travel back and forth.

231
00:16:17,282 --> 00:16:19,440
With all the activity in this house,

232
00:16:19,441 --> 00:16:23,155
I need to know about the previous owners.

233
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:29,056
So I went to the local library to see
what I can uncover in their records.

234
00:16:33,665 --> 00:16:35,594
Digging through the archives,

235
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:38,426
I was shocked to discover that
two brothers committed suicide,

236
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:42,387
at the location I'm investigating.

237
00:16:42,485 --> 00:16:45,868
The newspaper articles
didn't have many details.

238
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:48,149
So I'm headed over to meet
with a retired Belvidere cop,

239
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:53,130
who says he's got information
to help my case.

240
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,656
What were you able to find
out about these suicides?

241
00:17:00,657 --> 00:17:03,037
Well, actually, Steve, this was
one of the most interesting

242
00:17:03,038 --> 00:17:05,461
cases I've ever looked into.

243
00:17:05,462 --> 00:17:10,862
Back in 1939, Thomas Smith,
a 24-year-old young man,

244
00:17:10,866 --> 00:17:16,132
was quite despondent, and he ended up
having an argument with his girlfriend.

245
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:20,082
And later that evening, he
went out into the kitchen,

246
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:23,660
and took a.22 caliber pistol.

247
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:26,747
And shot himself in the heart.

248
00:17:26,748 --> 00:17:32,388
I was able to come up with the
actual death certificate.

249
00:17:34,226 --> 00:17:36,592
Now what about the second suicide?

250
00:17:36,593 --> 00:17:39,173
Well, in 1961,

251
00:17:39,343 --> 00:17:42,225
Thomas' brother Raymond,

252
00:17:42,226 --> 00:17:46,161
also committed suicide
using the exact same gun,

253
00:17:46,162 --> 00:17:50,126
that Thomas had shot himself
with 20 years earlier.

254
00:17:50,127 --> 00:17:55,827
And I also have a copy of the
Medical Examiner's report.

255
00:17:56,183 --> 00:18:01,151
He lived alone with his mother,
had no girlfriends, wasn't sick.

256
00:18:01,152 --> 00:18:07,052
There was really no indication as to
why he would want to commit suicide.

257
00:18:12,483 --> 00:18:15,963
This demon says he controls
the house and everyone in it.

258
00:18:15,964 --> 00:18:20,944
And I get the feeling
he's about to prove it.

259
00:18:24,376 --> 00:18:26,958
I think it's, uh, self-inflicted.

260
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:28,285
What do you mean?

261
00:18:28,286 --> 00:18:30,435
I saw...

262
00:18:30,436 --> 00:18:34,216
A noose hanging from the beams.

263
00:18:40,313 --> 00:18:44,094
Raymond takes the gun
that his brother used.

264
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:48,289
He shoots himself in the same
manner, but he doesn't die.

265
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,429
So he looks up and sees this rope,

266
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:55,739
decides to put it around his
neck, and hang himself.

267
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,158
Have you ever heard of anything like that?

268
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:03,059
No. Of the 23 years, I-I never
had anything like this happen.

269
00:19:06,087 --> 00:19:10,686
He says he was trying to find a way
out for a long time, long time.

270
00:19:10,687 --> 00:19:16,027
I guess he kind of just
lost his mind or something.

271
00:19:18,698 --> 00:19:21,905
There's a lot of blood.

272
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:25,268
I hear somebody yelling.
I hear a male yelling.

273
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:30,609
I hear a gunshot, and there's
the pain in my head.

274
00:19:33,445 --> 00:19:35,862
He doesn't like this. He
doesn't like that we're up...

275
00:19:35,863 --> 00:19:38,661
That we're in his... his domain.

276
00:19:38,662 --> 00:19:41,212
Who's "he" that you're talking about?

277
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:44,693
The man who killed himself.

278
00:19:50,927 --> 00:19:54,496
After Bill filled me in on
the details of the suicides.

279
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:57,301
Clearly I need to find out a lot
more about the Smith family,

280
00:19:57,302 --> 00:20:00,295
who owned the property I'm investigating.

281
00:20:00,296 --> 00:20:06,196
I've contacted a local historian who
tells me their story is a tragedy.

282
00:20:10,682 --> 00:20:13,838
The Smith family settled here about 1899.

283
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,296
Charles Smith was the father. He
settled the area, had 13 children.

284
00:20:17,297 --> 00:20:20,619
And then his oldest son
Edward took it over.

285
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,787
Okay.

286
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:24,053
Edward was married to a woman named Asika.

287
00:20:24,054 --> 00:20:29,075
And he had ten children, and of those,
six of them died on the property.

288
00:20:29,076 --> 00:20:31,462
Six? So it's more than
just the two suicides.

289
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,195
There were four children that died.

290
00:20:33,196 --> 00:20:36,928
We had one girl died at the age
of 6 from cancer of the arm.

291
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:40,406
Another girl died from
pneumonia at the age of 4.

292
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:44,385
The third girl died at the age
of 9 months from bronchitis.

293
00:20:44,386 --> 00:20:49,666
And finally, they had a
baby boy who was stillborn.

294
00:20:50,391 --> 00:20:53,802
Do you know why he killed himself?

295
00:20:53,803 --> 00:20:56,383
Sad, depressed.

296
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:00,881
I think a lot of his...

297
00:21:00,882 --> 00:21:05,520
His, uh, family or friends
or both were killed.

298
00:21:05,521 --> 00:21:07,684
Can you tell how they were killed?

299
00:21:07,685 --> 00:21:12,065
It's like, everybody's eating and
it's great and it's evening, and...

300
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:15,544
Something bad, and then they're dead.
Their all bodies are...

301
00:21:15,545 --> 00:21:19,750
They're all messed up. They are all bloody.

302
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:24,251
Everybody put in a hole or some [Bleep ].

303
00:21:27,692 --> 00:21:31,892
And he's, uh, he's all [Bleep ] up.

304
00:21:46,202 --> 00:21:49,779
I need to find out more about the Smith
family and what they went through.

305
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:54,021
So I've managed to track down a descendant
of the two brothers who killed themselves.

306
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:59,922
He says he's willing to talk to me about a
very dark chapter in his family's history.

307
00:22:05,994 --> 00:22:08,492
Trevor, thanks for meeting me.
I appreciate it.

308
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,706
You know I'm investigating Thomas,

309
00:22:10,707 --> 00:22:14,448
and Raymond's suicides on the
property that your family owned.

310
00:22:14,449 --> 00:22:17,767
What is your relationship
with Raymond and Thomas?

311
00:22:17,768 --> 00:22:22,928
My grandpa is Raymond and
Thomas' youngest brother.

312
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:28,243
What can you tell me about
their father, Ed Sr.?

313
00:22:28,244 --> 00:22:31,280
This is my great-grandfather.

314
00:22:31,281 --> 00:22:34,883
I heard he was a hardworking kind of man.

315
00:22:34,884 --> 00:22:39,209
They put in long-hour days, you know?
12, 13, 14 hours.

316
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:43,219
The winters were harsh,
but he enjoyed doing it.

317
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:48,620
Because they knew they had
to provide for the family.

318
00:22:48,995 --> 00:22:53,594
There's something about
this old man, grandpa.

319
00:22:53,595 --> 00:22:57,015
Like, an Ed, Eddie, Edgar.

320
00:22:57,088 --> 00:23:00,402
He's a farmer. Literally
the image of a farmer...

321
00:23:00,403 --> 00:23:04,783
Overalls, cut-off sleeves, big rosy guy.

322
00:23:05,815 --> 00:23:08,063
Anyways, he died.

323
00:23:08,064 --> 00:23:11,484
He comes here still. Uh...

324
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,775
I got to ask you a question... how did
these suicides affect your family?

325
00:23:16,776 --> 00:23:21,309
When Thomas committed suicide, they were
sad and they were heartbroken, but...

326
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:25,331
They kind of saw it happening since
him and his girlfriend broke up.

327
00:23:25,332 --> 00:23:29,517
But when Ray died, nobody
was expecting that.

328
00:23:29,518 --> 00:23:31,408
This is Raymond.

329
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:35,908
All in all, the family was upset,
but it kind of erased the family.

330
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:39,721
You know, kind of made them
just go all their own ways.

331
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:42,880
Trevor, I read in an article that
your great-grandmother Asika,

332
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:46,969
basically had no emotion or no
reaction when they found Raymond.

333
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:51,021
I believe myself that she was
more shell-shocked or just,

334
00:23:51,022 --> 00:23:53,711
all in all just shocked about it.

335
00:23:53,712 --> 00:23:57,933
That was her, and then this
is after Raymond passed away.

336
00:23:57,934 --> 00:24:02,929
Within two years, three years after
Ray died, Asika passed away.

337
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:06,404
She, uh, came down with an illness,

338
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:09,610
and then she went anorexic
and she was 63 pounds.

339
00:24:09,611 --> 00:24:12,080
So she took it probably the hardest.

340
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:14,287
She committed suicide, too, in a sense.

341
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:17,087
I mean, you know, she just
pretty much quite eating,

342
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:22,788
went into a bad depression,
and just took her from there.

343
00:24:23,634 --> 00:24:26,606
Some woman, her heart's broken.

344
00:24:26,607 --> 00:24:29,077
Nobody's gonna do anything
to make it right,

345
00:24:29,078 --> 00:24:32,138
and she is not okay.

346
00:24:32,396 --> 00:24:35,276
About any of this.

347
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:39,074
So she keeps skipping through time.

348
00:24:39,075 --> 00:24:43,321
So I see her younger. She's happy.
It's summer.

349
00:24:43,322 --> 00:24:47,522
All good things, and then she's old.

350
00:24:50,173 --> 00:24:52,443
She's so sad.

351
00:24:52,444 --> 00:24:54,529
And lost.

352
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,684
Why is she sad?

353
00:24:55,685 --> 00:25:00,005
She feels, like, a huge sense of loss.

354
00:25:00,406 --> 00:25:03,134
Do you know if she was here on
this property when she was living?

355
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:04,995
Yes.

356
00:25:10,573 --> 00:25:13,918
A lot of bizarre activity has
taken place on Franco's property.

357
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,812
And Judy's worried that it's
followed her to her new home.

358
00:25:17,813 --> 00:25:20,434
As much as I don't like breaking the rules.

359
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:24,293
I need to meet with Amy and
have her walk Judy's house.

360
00:25:24,294 --> 00:25:27,474
Okay, I'll set it up.

361
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:50,829
There's stuff that comes
inside from out here.

362
00:25:50,837 --> 00:25:53,117
There's...

363
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:55,283
People.

364
00:25:55,284 --> 00:25:57,601
They've been called.

365
00:25:57,602 --> 00:26:03,182
They've been asked to come
into the back of the house.

366
00:26:08,032 --> 00:26:09,813
What do you mean, they've
been asked to come?

367
00:26:09,814 --> 00:26:11,060
They've been invited.

368
00:26:11,061 --> 00:26:16,961
So I'm assuming one of the owners
or both invited them to come here.

369
00:26:17,608 --> 00:26:21,584
A lot of dead people are being
drawn to this location.

370
00:26:21,585 --> 00:26:25,719
Either the people who live here are
trying to communicate with them.

371
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,491
Or they have abilities that are
unintentionally attracting the dead.

372
00:26:30,492 --> 00:26:32,482
I feel like there are
two people that are...

373
00:26:32,483 --> 00:26:37,003
Have been having experiences. And
there's so much, like, tr...

374
00:26:37,004 --> 00:26:41,012
Like, these voices that are in
the air constantly talking.

375
00:26:41,013 --> 00:26:46,043
My body doesn't feel comfortable here.
It's like, you know...

376
00:26:46,044 --> 00:26:48,864
This annoying hum.

377
00:26:49,634 --> 00:26:52,330
Is what's going on dangerous for them?

378
00:26:52,331 --> 00:26:55,272
Yeah, open invitation.

379
00:26:55,273 --> 00:26:59,353
They've had nasty [Bleep ] come in.

380
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:08,008
During my walk, I
encountered many entities.

381
00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:11,566
I wanted to sketch the
two I saw most clearly.

382
00:27:11,567 --> 00:27:14,115
First, the old woman.

383
00:27:14,116 --> 00:27:18,796
She's probably in her 80s, very round face.

384
00:27:18,802 --> 00:27:23,646
Very, very thin hair going
down to about here.

385
00:27:23,647 --> 00:27:29,547
Her eyes are actually rather large, round,
and kind of bulbous, like, protruding.

386
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:33,027
Next, I describe the 7-foot-tall entity.

387
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:36,748
It was wearing a mask, so
it has a very oval head.

388
00:27:36,749 --> 00:27:42,029
The eyes on the mask are...
are very almond-shaped.

389
00:27:42,305 --> 00:27:44,793
It has a stripe.

390
00:27:44,794 --> 00:27:49,234
It goes right across the eyes like that.

391
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:52,434
Amy, is this what you saw?

392
00:27:52,435 --> 00:27:54,295
Yes.

393
00:28:16,275 --> 00:28:19,446
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations.

394
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:25,347
We're ready to reveal our findings to the
clients and each other for the first time.

395
00:28:29,093 --> 00:28:33,245
Amy, I want to introduce you
to three generations here.

396
00:28:33,246 --> 00:28:35,194
Franco lives here.

397
00:28:35,195 --> 00:28:37,684
Judy and Frankie did live here.

398
00:28:37,685 --> 00:28:42,369
And things got so bad for the three of them
that Judy and Frankie actually moved out.

399
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:46,312
Big concern here is, is it
safe for Franco to stay.

400
00:28:46,313 --> 00:28:50,254
And have Judy and Frankie taken
something back to where they live now,

401
00:28:50,255 --> 00:28:51,786
and are they gonna be okay?

402
00:28:51,787 --> 00:28:57,487
So with that, Amy will start
and tell us about her walk.

403
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,377
The first thing that I
got was this little...

404
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:09,150
Creature, maybe about this tall.

405
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:12,004
And, um, it would burrow into the ground.

406
00:29:12,005 --> 00:29:14,509
And it felt very, very negative.

407
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:19,857
And then I saw these creature
things out in the yard.

408
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:24,935
They were, like, 7 feet tall,
abnormally long arms, muscular.

409
00:29:24,936 --> 00:29:29,856
They were wearing two
different types of masks.

410
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:36,394
When I was a little kid, I would
go to bed, uh, and in the dream,

411
00:29:36,395 --> 00:29:40,093
I would be looking out my
second-floor window into the yard.

412
00:29:40,094 --> 00:29:44,792
And I would see just one man standing
there wouldn't do nothing, wouldn't move.

413
00:29:44,793 --> 00:29:49,325
He had a mask on, and I would
have that dream constantly.

414
00:29:49,326 --> 00:29:52,060
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

415
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:54,741
Okay, all right, I drew it.

416
00:29:54,742 --> 00:29:58,762
You did a sketch of what you saw.

417
00:30:02,564 --> 00:30:04,424
Wow.

418
00:30:14,862 --> 00:30:18,134
Well, I think I'd be afraid if I saw
that in the middle of the night, too.

419
00:30:18,135 --> 00:30:20,775
Yeah, that's...

420
00:30:20,855 --> 00:30:23,495
Looks like him.

421
00:30:24,503 --> 00:30:26,903
It's scary.

422
00:30:29,325 --> 00:30:32,961
Are they, like, guardians or something?

423
00:30:32,962 --> 00:30:35,902
Not in a good way.

424
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:43,091
I wouldn't know why you
would call that a guardian.

425
00:30:43,815 --> 00:30:45,466
Okay, Amy, what else did you see?

426
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:50,394
When I came in here, I saw
this, uh, really nice guy.

427
00:30:50,395 --> 00:30:52,129
Uh, he's a farmer.

428
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:55,044
Um, he lived here. I know he died here.

429
00:30:55,045 --> 00:31:00,075
He comes in the barn a lot, but he's all
around, and his name was Ed or Eddie.

430
00:31:00,076 --> 00:31:02,139
You're kidding.

431
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,933
- Ed or Eddie?
- Mm-hmm.

432
00:31:04,934 --> 00:31:07,967
Do me a favor before I move
on, just tell her about...

433
00:31:07,968 --> 00:31:11,081
Franco, if you can, the
guy you saw in the house.

434
00:31:11,082 --> 00:31:15,728
The guy that I saw in the
house was very tall, lean.

435
00:31:15,729 --> 00:31:17,415
Uh...

436
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:19,540
Very old-fashionedly dressed.

437
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:22,540
The original settler on this land
was a second-generation farmer,

438
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:24,767
by the name of Eddie Smith, Edward Smith.

439
00:31:24,768 --> 00:31:28,748
And he, uh, farmed this
land for probably 70 years.

440
00:31:28,749 --> 00:31:31,607
He was a nice guy, apparently.
He was... ten children.

441
00:31:31,608 --> 00:31:33,528
Jeez.

442
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,173
Now that looks more like what I seen.

443
00:31:39,174 --> 00:31:41,454
Is that...

444
00:31:42,524 --> 00:31:46,112
He looked just like that. I
seen him with my own eyes.

445
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,546
- Do you think this could have been him?
- I mean, yeah.

446
00:31:48,547 --> 00:31:51,247
It's incredible.

447
00:31:52,884 --> 00:31:56,211
The other person that I saw
was right here in this barn.

448
00:31:56,212 --> 00:31:58,737
He, like, was suicidal.

449
00:31:58,738 --> 00:32:00,849
He just kind of snapped.

450
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:04,583
I saw an old pistol, and
then I heard a gunshot.

451
00:32:04,584 --> 00:32:10,464
But I'm looking at these, and
I'm like, "he hung himself".

452
00:32:12,134 --> 00:32:15,262
She almost nailed this down to 100%.

453
00:32:15,263 --> 00:32:20,783
His son Raymond in 1961
committed suicide in this barn.

454
00:32:21,219 --> 00:32:22,497
This is Raymond.

455
00:32:22,498 --> 00:32:27,824
He committed suicide by shooting himself
in the chest with an old pistol.

456
00:32:27,825 --> 00:32:29,534
Oh, my God.

457
00:32:29,535 --> 00:32:33,366
- Apparently he didn't die right away...
- Oh, my God.

458
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:36,769
So he decided that he
wasn't dying fast enough.

459
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,881
He took a rope and then hung himself.

460
00:32:38,882 --> 00:32:42,724
I know ten people personally
that have committed suicide.

461
00:32:42,725 --> 00:32:45,694
And nine out of those ten,
I could see it coming.

462
00:32:45,695 --> 00:32:49,473
They didn't see that with this guy.
They did not see it coming at all.

463
00:32:49,474 --> 00:32:53,554
So it was pretty much a big shock.

464
00:32:56,138 --> 00:32:58,826
You look upset, Judy.

465
00:32:58,827 --> 00:33:01,966
Tell Amy what you saw...

466
00:33:01,967 --> 00:33:04,247
That time.

467
00:33:04,966 --> 00:33:06,810
My dad went out of town and I had...

468
00:33:06,811 --> 00:33:10,491
He asked me to come here one evening
to take care of the animals.

469
00:33:10,492 --> 00:33:14,424
I looked up, and I saw a guy look
like this out the window at me,

470
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:17,444
and I just turned around and
ran for the house screaming.

471
00:33:17,445 --> 00:33:22,263
I don't think I've ever been
so petrified in my life.

472
00:33:22,264 --> 00:33:25,446
Same thing kind of along the
lines with my mother...

473
00:33:25,447 --> 00:33:27,213
I look up at the barn.

474
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:32,080
Just some reason made me look, you
know, and I notice this white figure

475
00:33:32,081 --> 00:33:35,738
peeking its head through the window,
but at the same time trying to hide.

476
00:33:35,739 --> 00:33:36,778
It was the same window.

477
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:38,262
- The same window.
- Okay.

478
00:33:38,263 --> 00:33:44,023
Didn't want us to know he was
there, but he was peeking.

479
00:33:44,787 --> 00:33:48,672
Well, there's a little bit of a kicker to
the whole story about the Smith family.

480
00:33:48,673 --> 00:33:50,906
Raymond here had an older brother,

481
00:33:50,907 --> 00:33:55,763
that committed suicide in the kitchen
of your house, with the same exact gun

482
00:33:55,764 --> 00:33:57,899
- that he killed himself with.
- Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?

483
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,258
The same.22 caliber gun.

484
00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:02,618
He shot himself in the chest area.

485
00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:05,793
The same exact way he did in
the kitchen of your house.

486
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,654
Hmm.

487
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:11,988
I saw friends and family off to the side.

488
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:14,520
Um... and then I saw them all dead.

489
00:34:14,521 --> 00:34:16,265
Really? How many?

490
00:34:16,266 --> 00:34:18,183
Five or six.

491
00:34:18,184 --> 00:34:20,651
The story of the Smith
family is pretty tragic.

492
00:34:20,652 --> 00:34:24,907
He had ten kids. Six of
'em died, two to suicide.

493
00:34:24,908 --> 00:34:28,330
He also had a 6-year-old daughter
who died of cancer of the arm...

494
00:34:28,331 --> 00:34:29,523
Oh, my gosh.

495
00:34:29,524 --> 00:34:33,224
Yeah, he had a 5-year-old
daughter died of pneumonia.

496
00:34:33,225 --> 00:34:37,547
He had a 9-month-old
daughter died of bronchitis.

497
00:34:37,548 --> 00:34:40,675
And then he had a son that was stillborn.

498
00:34:40,676 --> 00:34:44,064
That explains what I saw, probably.

499
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:48,020
I was in my living room one
night, and I see this little...

500
00:34:48,021 --> 00:34:52,613
White ball on the floor, and you could
tell it was, like, a preemie baby.

501
00:34:52,614 --> 00:34:55,223
- Mm.
- Just kind of arms and feet moving.

502
00:34:55,224 --> 00:35:00,984
You could tell the shape of a
baby, but not fully formed.

503
00:35:05,007 --> 00:35:06,882
So what else did you see?

504
00:35:06,883 --> 00:35:12,174
Outside over here I met, um, an older
lady, and she was really heartbroken.

505
00:35:12,175 --> 00:35:14,523
And she was, like, old.

506
00:35:14,524 --> 00:35:19,111
She's just so, uh, sad and lost that, um,

507
00:35:19,112 --> 00:35:21,668
you know, nothing can make it better.

508
00:35:21,669 --> 00:35:23,222
Who would that sound like?

509
00:35:23,223 --> 00:35:24,832
- The mom, right?
- Right.

510
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:27,234
Ed Sr.'s wife was named Asika.

511
00:35:27,235 --> 00:35:31,680
After Raymond killed himself, she
just went into a downward spiral.

512
00:35:31,681 --> 00:35:35,383
And she wound up dying three years later.

513
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:37,265
I got a photo of her.

514
00:35:37,266 --> 00:35:40,201
She was 63 pounds when she died.

515
00:35:40,202 --> 00:35:42,902
Oh, my goodness.

516
00:35:42,923 --> 00:35:45,426
So I sketched the sad woman.

517
00:35:45,427 --> 00:35:48,378
- The woman you saw?
- Mm-hmm.

518
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:51,079
She's just sad.

519
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:54,469
Wow.

520
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:58,370
You guys tell me what you think.

521
00:36:18,267 --> 00:36:22,707
So I sketched the sad woman that I saw.

522
00:36:28,744 --> 00:36:32,485
You guys tell me what you think.

523
00:36:32,486 --> 00:36:34,346
Wow.

524
00:36:44,593 --> 00:36:46,629
Yeah, I'd call that her.

525
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,672
Mm-hmm.

526
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:51,766
- Yeah, that looks like the mouth exactly.
- Yeah.

527
00:36:51,767 --> 00:36:55,727
Definitely in the mouth, the nose.

528
00:36:56,175 --> 00:37:00,800
- You do think this is her.
- Yeah, it's very possible.

529
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,555
So they're still here?

530
00:37:02,556 --> 00:37:05,745
Like, they could be standing right
next to us right now as we speak?

531
00:37:05,746 --> 00:37:07,606
Yes.

532
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:19,167
The other thing that I saw when I
went into the house was a child.

533
00:37:19,168 --> 00:37:21,133
A 5-year-old little boy.

534
00:37:21,134 --> 00:37:25,029
He was very Angelic-looking,
except he didn't have any eyes,

535
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:28,120
and there were, like, this
light coming out of his eyes.

536
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:31,277
His main area is the house,
but he can go anywhere.

537
00:37:31,278 --> 00:37:34,638
He's very, very powerful.

538
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:41,104
Initially he showed me, like,
this sweet little boy.

539
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:43,482
But it... it wasn't real.

540
00:37:43,483 --> 00:37:46,506
It was to gain my sympathy, to trick me.

541
00:37:46,507 --> 00:37:50,791
And then when I chased him out of
the barn, he turned into the...

542
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:54,212
That little creature thing.

543
00:37:55,052 --> 00:38:00,692
It dove into the ground and
was burrowing in the ground.

544
00:38:01,684 --> 00:38:05,092
The child is not a child.

545
00:38:05,093 --> 00:38:08,459
It's some kind of demonic presence.

546
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:14,280
And what it did to this family
was it caused two suicides.

547
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:17,985
It probably influenced them to do it.

548
00:38:17,986 --> 00:38:21,324
And probably killed the girls...

549
00:38:21,325 --> 00:38:25,814
The children, because they're weak, and...

550
00:38:25,815 --> 00:38:28,676
Completely destroyed the family.

551
00:38:28,677 --> 00:38:31,576
You were concerned about Frankie because
you feel like you were losing him,

552
00:38:31,577 --> 00:38:33,231
at some point?

553
00:38:33,232 --> 00:38:37,559
Yeah, I mean, he was getting
to the point where...

554
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,920
You know, like, nothing mattered and...

555
00:38:40,921 --> 00:38:43,869
Just became distant, you know?

556
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:47,830
And I don't want that to happen.

557
00:38:54,446 --> 00:38:58,798
Well, there's obviously
a lot going on here.

558
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:00,830
Two biggest questions...

559
00:39:00,831 --> 00:39:03,679
Is it safe for Franco at this house,

560
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,790
and did this thing follow you two guys to
your new home, and are you safe there?

561
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:13,691
With that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy,
and hopefully, she will have an answer.

562
00:39:16,844 --> 00:39:20,398
In your house, you guys are getting
an influx of random people,

563
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:24,390
and things coming in the back
door and the back window.

564
00:39:24,391 --> 00:39:30,224
But the good news is that your
house is a lot easier to contain.

565
00:39:30,225 --> 00:39:34,044
Um, all you need to do
is bring in a holy man.

566
00:39:34,045 --> 00:39:37,067
Who will have a blessing
done and a sealing done.

567
00:39:37,068 --> 00:39:38,293
Okay.

568
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:42,389
But this property, your situation
is a little bit different.

569
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:44,883
You know, this thing's
been here for a long time.

570
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:46,849
It can affect people.

571
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:51,590
So you really need to not only get the
blessing and get the sealing done,

572
00:39:51,591 --> 00:39:56,711
but also you need to bring in a Shaman
who will deal with the Elementals.

573
00:39:56,712 --> 00:40:00,119
And seal up the property so that the...

574
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:04,020
Demonic thing can't get back in.

575
00:40:04,811 --> 00:40:07,547
Elementals are entities created by nature.

576
00:40:07,548 --> 00:40:10,437
The creature tormenting
this family never lived.

577
00:40:10,438 --> 00:40:14,534
So a priest wouldn't be able to
get rid of it, only a Shaman.

578
00:40:14,535 --> 00:40:18,460
My concern is that if you don't take
care of this, what could happen?

579
00:40:18,461 --> 00:40:22,040
Ooh, it'd be bad. It'll continue.

580
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:24,080
So what... what do they do first?

581
00:40:24,081 --> 00:40:26,767
It'd be great if you could do it
all at the same time, really.

582
00:40:26,768 --> 00:40:31,429
Like, if you could have the Shaman here
and have the priest or the holy man.

583
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,064
That would be great.

584
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:36,006
You have that look on your face
like you don't believe her.

585
00:40:36,007 --> 00:40:41,907
No, I've heard stories before actually
from my friend, uh, that is half Indian.

586
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,902
How this one family had evil spirits
and they called one of these shamans,

587
00:40:45,903 --> 00:40:49,795
and got rid of all those evil
spirits that were in the house.

588
00:40:49,796 --> 00:40:51,628
Okay, so you're gonna take
Amy's advice and do this?

589
00:40:51,629 --> 00:40:52,819
Yes.

590
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,157
In your opinion,

591
00:40:54,158 --> 00:40:57,819
do you think once they take care of
all this that things will get better?

592
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:02,579
I think that their home environment
will be much better, you know?

593
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,510
The chaos will subside.

594
00:41:05,511 --> 00:41:08,271
I don't want to see what
happened to this family...

595
00:41:08,272 --> 00:41:11,268
God forbid. Happen to your family.

596
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:14,736
That's why I want you to promise that
you'll at least do what you have to do,

597
00:41:14,737 --> 00:41:17,502
and I can walk out of here
tonight feeling better.

598
00:41:17,503 --> 00:41:19,607
You can guarantee I will be doing that.

599
00:41:19,608 --> 00:41:21,794
Okay, what about you?

600
00:41:21,795 --> 00:41:25,010
Yeah. I'm definitely gonna
take up what she said.

601
00:41:25,011 --> 00:41:26,931
Okay.

602
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:31,224
I witnessed exactly what Frankie
saw, and the sketch proves it.

603
00:41:31,225 --> 00:41:34,029
But that can be hard for
a young man to accept.

604
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,307
I just hope this family
keeps their promise,

605
00:41:36,308 --> 00:41:41,350
because I believe their
lives could depend on it.
