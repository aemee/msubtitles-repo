00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:05,397 --> 00:00:08,133
He said that he'd kill me if I came here.

3
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:11,887
As I looked up, I saw a face
look out the window at me.

4
00:00:11,888 --> 00:00:15,039
This little kid becomes, like, the devil.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,547
You can see its head just...

6
00:00:18,548 --> 00:00:20,648
Hanging.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,683
He lets things in that are
really bad sometimes.

8
00:00:25,684 --> 00:00:28,163
And I'm very, very concerned
for the welfare of my son.

9
00:00:28,164 --> 00:00:30,928
Like, they could be standing right
next to us right now as we speak.

10
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:33,149
Oh, yeah.

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,163
They're being watched.

12
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:41,284
My name is Amy Allan.

13
00:00:41,352 --> 00:00:43,868
This thing likes death.

14
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:45,386
I see dead people.

15
00:00:45,387 --> 00:00:46,983
This thing is, like, a monster.

16
00:00:46,984 --> 00:00:48,935
I speak to dead people...

17
00:00:48,936 --> 00:00:50,673
And he's pissed off now.

18
00:00:50,674 --> 00:00:52,038
And they speak to me.

19
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:53,745
His head was cracked.

20
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:57,048
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

21
00:00:57,049 --> 00:00:58,731
This guy was murdered.

22
00:00:58,732 --> 00:01:00,209
I rely on my partner.

23
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,671
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

24
00:01:01,672 --> 00:01:03,612
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

25
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:06,147
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

26
00:01:06,148 --> 00:01:09,451
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

27
00:01:09,452 --> 00:01:12,153
You saw her? It's my job to reveal them.

28
00:01:12,154 --> 00:01:13,487
Why would you stay here?

29
00:01:13,488 --> 00:01:15,437
But Steve and I never speak...

30
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:17,592
We never communicate
during an investigation.

31
00:01:17,593 --> 00:01:19,060
Until the very end.

32
00:01:19,061 --> 00:01:20,796
Stop it. Stop it.

33
00:01:20,797 --> 00:01:22,764
We uncover if it's safe for you to stay...

34
00:01:22,765 --> 00:01:25,180
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

35
00:01:25,181 --> 00:01:26,468
Or time to get out.

36
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:31,149
I told you there were ghosts in this house.

37
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:58,059
Amy and I conduct our
investigations separately.

38
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,448
I interview witnesses and uncover
dark secrets from the past.

39
00:02:02,449 --> 00:02:05,645
While Amy communicates with the other side.

40
00:02:05,646 --> 00:02:10,986
At the end, we come together
to reveal our findings.

41
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,987
I'm in the small farming
town of Belvidere, Illinois.

42
00:02:18,988 --> 00:02:22,822
It's about an hour and a
half north of Chicago.

43
00:02:22,823 --> 00:02:25,837
We've been called in by a woman named Judy.

44
00:02:25,838 --> 00:02:27,672
She sounds hysterical.

45
00:02:27,673 --> 00:02:31,939
She says weird stuff is happening
and it's tearing her family apart.

46
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,927
She's afraid for her son and her dad.

47
00:02:34,928 --> 00:02:40,828
I'm hoping we can help her out,
because this one sounds bad.

48
00:02:50,052 --> 00:02:55,952
Before Amy arrives, I clear the
area of any leading information.

49
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,856
This location is not only
filled with pictures,

50
00:03:00,857 --> 00:03:04,833
but many unique items that
I have to cover or remove.

51
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:10,054
Once the house is cleared,
Amy can begin her walk.

52
00:03:33,163 --> 00:03:39,063
So there's, like, some really
significant stuff going on here.

53
00:03:41,373 --> 00:03:43,953
Right in here.

...
...
...
and have the priest or the holy man.

583
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,064
That would be great.

584
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:36,006
You have that look on your face
like you don't believe her.

585
00:40:36,007 --> 00:40:41,907
No, I've heard stories before actually
from my friend, uh, that is half Indian.

586
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,902
How this one family had evil spirits
and they called one of these shamans,

587
00:40:45,903 --> 00:40:49,795
and got rid of all those evil
spirits that were in the house.

588
00:40:49,796 --> 00:40:51,628
Okay, so you're gonna take
Amy's advice and do this?

589
00:40:51,629 --> 00:40:52,819
Yes.

590
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,157
In your opinion,

591
00:40:54,158 --> 00:40:57,819
do you think once they take care of
all this that things will get better?

592
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:02,579
I think that their home environment
will be much better, you know?

593
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,510
The chaos will subside.

594
00:41:05,511 --> 00:41:08,271
I don't want to see what
happened to this family...

595
00:41:08,272 --> 00:41:11,268
God forbid. Happen to your family.

596
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:14,736
That's why I want you to promise that
you'll at least do what you have to do,

597
00:41:14,737 --> 00:41:17,502
and I can walk out of here
tonight feeling better.

598
00:41:17,503 --> 00:41:19,607
You can guarantee I will be doing that.

599
00:41:19,608 --> 00:41:21,794
Okay, what about you?

600
00:41:21,795 --> 00:41:25,010
Yeah. I'm definitely gonna
take up what she said.

601
00:41:25,011 --> 00:41:26,931
Okay.

602
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:31,224
I witnessed exactly what Frankie
saw, and the sketch proves it.

603
00:41:31,225 --> 00:41:34,029
But that can be hard for
a young man to accept.

604
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,307
I just hope this family
keeps their promise,

605
00:41:36,308 --> 00:41:41,350
because I believe their
lives could depend on it.
