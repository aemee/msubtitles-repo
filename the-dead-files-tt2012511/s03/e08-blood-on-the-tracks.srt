Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:05,445 --> 00:00:08,381
There's a lot of frickin' dead people.

3
00:00:08,382 --> 00:00:10,949
- How are you sleeping at night?
- I don't.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,022
It wants to take them down
there and mutilate them.

5
00:00:14,023 --> 00:00:16,497
It feels like someone's
gonna come out and get me.

6
00:00:16,498 --> 00:00:18,808
- You think she's in danger?
- Yes, I do.

7
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:20,674
He had a very dark past.

8
00:00:20,675 --> 00:00:23,710
This thing can possess you.

9
00:00:23,711 --> 00:00:25,913
I am scared to death to
be down here right now.

10
00:00:25,914 --> 00:00:29,034
There's real monsters.

11
00:00:29,818 --> 00:00:33,598
She said that we'll meet them.

12
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:36,511
They're being watched.

13
00:00:36,512 --> 00:00:39,414
My name is Amy Allan.

14
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:42,044
This thing likes death.

15
00:00:42,045 --> 00:00:43,412
I see dead people.

16
00:00:43,413 --> 00:00:44,846
This thing is, like, a monster.

17
00:00:44,847 --> 00:00:46,681
I speak to dead people...

18
00:00:46,682 --> 00:00:48,717
And he's pissed off now.

19
00:00:48,718 --> 00:00:50,072
And they speak to me.

20
00:00:50,073 --> 00:00:51,844
His head was cracked.

21
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:55,221
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

22
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,879
This guy was murdered.

23
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,337
I rely on my partner.

24
00:00:58,338 --> 00:00:59,733
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

25
00:00:59,734 --> 00:01:01,468
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

26
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,037
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

27
00:01:04,038 --> 00:01:07,501
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

28
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:10,201
You saw her? It's my job to reveal them.

29
00:01:10,202 --> 00:01:11,678
Why would you stay here?

30
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:13,520
But Steve and I never speak.

31
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:15,572
We never communicate
during an investigation.

32
00:01:15,573 --> 00:01:16,932
Until the very end.

33
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,652
Stop it.

34
00:01:18,653 --> 00:01:21,061
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

35
00:01:21,062 --> 00:01:23,364
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

36
00:01:23,365 --> 00:01:24,708
Or time to get out.

37
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:29,389
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

38
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:57,081
Amy and I conduct our
investigations separately.

39
00:01:57,608 --> 00:02:03,428
I interview witnesses and
research the history of a location.

40
00:02:03,552 --> 00:02:08,275
While Amy communicates with
those on the other side.

41
00:02:08,276 --> 00:02:13,914
At the end, we'll get together and
reveal our findings to the clients.

42
00:02:13,915 --> 00:02:19,815
I'm in Garrett, Indiana, an old rail
road town just outside of Fort Wayne.

43
00:02:19,903 --> 00:02:22,403
I got a call from a
young girl named Leah.

44
00:02:22,404 --> 00:02:25,406
She says she desperately needs our help.

45
00:02:25,407 --> 00:02:28,763
She told me that her and her new
husband just moved into their first home.

46
00:02:28,764 --> 00:02:34,664
And that things got so weird so fast,
she's afraid to be in the house alone.

47
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:52,812
Before Amy arrives, I look for anything
that could influence her findings.

48
00:02:53,377 --> 00:02:55,736
This house has a lot
of personal photographs,

49
00:02:55,737 --> 00:02:58,005
so it's important I remove them all.

50
00:02:58,006 --> 00:03:03,346
Once the location is cleared,
Amy can begin her walk.

51
00:03:15,523 --> 00:03:19,594
As I approach this location, dead
people are already surrounding me.

52
00:03:19,595 --> 00:03:25,115
They are warning me of
...
...
...
Make a protective boundary, but
it's going to be around the bed.

603
00:40:15,634 --> 00:40:19,079
And then you're going to take this.

604
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,959
What is that?

605
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,592
It's called tar-water.

606
00:40:23,593 --> 00:40:28,993
This is very, very potent
stuff, um, from New Orleans.

607
00:40:29,014 --> 00:40:31,342
Tar-water dates back to Medieval times,

608
00:40:31,343 --> 00:40:33,785
and is often used in voodoo practices.

609
00:40:33,786 --> 00:40:39,412
It consists of pine tar, water,
and other ritualistic medicines.

610
00:40:39,413 --> 00:40:42,858
Go through the house and
put one drop in each room.

611
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:47,384
What this means is that no dead
person, even the nice ones...

612
00:40:47,385 --> 00:40:49,267
Are going to be able to remain.

613
00:40:49,268 --> 00:40:54,548
Nothing will ever be able
to enter your house again.

614
00:40:54,740 --> 00:41:00,250
I never, never use this stuff, because
I personally really like dead people.

615
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:05,664
But I feel in this case this is
something that needs to be done.

616
00:41:05,665 --> 00:41:09,201
That's it. No more dead people, okay?

617
00:41:09,202 --> 00:41:12,967
You gotta make me a promise that
you're gonna do what she tells you.

618
00:41:12,968 --> 00:41:15,808
Absolutely. Probably
in less than 12 hours.

619
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:19,062
Okay. How you feeling
now about all this stuff?

620
00:41:19,063 --> 00:41:23,942
Well, if it helps her
relax, then let's do it.

621
00:41:23,943 --> 00:41:28,503
I'm glad we can get rid of those things.

622
00:41:31,067 --> 00:41:33,487
I really hope Leah and
Rudy follow my advice,

623
00:41:33,488 --> 00:41:37,285
and rid their home of the
entities lurking inside.

624
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:43,186
If they do, it should set the dead free
and allow them to begin a family in peace.
