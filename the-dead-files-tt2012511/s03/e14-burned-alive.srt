Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,949
So much has happened here.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,293
I'm going through their
deaths... one, two, three, four.

4
00:00:11,294 --> 00:00:14,340
I didn't even know if I
was gonna live through it.

5
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:16,103
I could feel them touching.

6
00:00:16,104 --> 00:00:18,595
She was pushed down the stairs.

7
00:00:18,596 --> 00:00:20,740
It is an excruciating death.

8
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:22,688
- And they hung them.
- They hung them.

9
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,445
They're bent on revenge.

10
00:00:24,446 --> 00:00:25,946
Is it dangerous?

11
00:00:25,947 --> 00:00:29,549
You get bad people in a bad place.

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,090
Bad things are gonna happen.

13
00:00:34,222 --> 00:00:36,102
They're being watched.

14
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:39,010
My name is Amy Allan.

15
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:41,261
This thing likes death.

16
00:00:41,262 --> 00:00:43,044
I see dead people.

17
00:00:43,045 --> 00:00:44,612
This thing is, like, a monster.

18
00:00:44,613 --> 00:00:46,682
I speak to dead people.

19
00:00:46,683 --> 00:00:48,372
And he's pissed off now.

20
00:00:48,373 --> 00:00:49,881
And they speak to me.

21
00:00:49,882 --> 00:00:51,477
His head was cracked.

22
00:00:51,478 --> 00:00:54,457
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

23
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,507
This guy was murdered.

24
00:00:56,508 --> 00:00:57,926
I rely on my partner.

25
00:00:57,927 --> 00:00:59,330
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

26
00:00:59,331 --> 00:01:01,281
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

27
00:01:01,282 --> 00:01:03,999
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,092
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

29
00:01:07,093 --> 00:01:10,005
You saw her? It's my job to reveal them.

30
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:11,158
Why would you stay here?

31
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,282
But Steve and I never speak...

32
00:01:13,283 --> 00:01:15,266
We never communicate
during an investigation.

33
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:16,678
Until the very end.

34
00:01:16,679 --> 00:01:18,452
Stop it.

35
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,616
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

36
00:01:20,617 --> 00:01:23,022
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

37
00:01:23,023 --> 00:01:24,377
Or time to get out.

38
00:01:24,378 --> 00:01:29,058
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

39
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:52,468
Amy and I conduct our
investigations separately.

40
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:55,113
I interview witnesses, local experts,

41
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:59,141
and look for anything unusual
about the history of the location.

42
00:01:59,142 --> 00:02:03,587
At the end, we meet with our
clients to reveal our findings.

43
00:02:03,588 --> 00:02:06,798
I'm in downtown Seattle to
meet a woman named Darcy.

44
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,734
She was a big-time
skeptic of the paranormal.

45
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:11,570
Then she bought a restaurant.

46
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:16,494
Now she's seeing strange things, and she
thinks it's making her physically sick.

47
00:02:16,495 --> 00:02:20,078
She's afraid of losing her
business, her health, and her sanity.

48
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:24,399
Hopefully, Amy and I can help her out.

49
00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:32,832
Before Amy enters a location,

50
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:36,022
I clear it of anything that
could be leading information.

51
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:39,095
This restaurant has a lot of
photographs and historical items.

52
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:43,702
So it's important I take my
time to cover or remove them all.

53
00:02:43,703 --> 00:02:46,463
Once I'm done...

54
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:50,773
Amy can begin her walk.

55
00:03:17,137 --> 00:03:20,917
There's, like, too many people.

56
00:03:25,682 --> 00:03:27,143
What's going on?

57
00:03:27,144 --> 00:03:31,524
I'm experiencing about 20 to 30 deaths.

58
00:03:33,084 --> 00:03:35,797
And it's wreaking havoc on my body.

59
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:39,710
I have all these lives
going through my mind.

60
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:43,251
There is some crazy [Bleep].

61
00:04:00,903 --> 00:04:02,184
Hey, Darcy.

62
00:04:02,185 --> 00:04:04,369
You sounded really
concerned on the phone.

63
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,774
Okay, what's going on?

64
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:08,737
I just got this business
a year and a half ago.

65
00:04:08,738 --> 00:04:11,837
And I've had guests that believe
they've been pushed down the stairs,

66
00:04:11,838 --> 00:04:13,512
guests that have seen apparitions.

67
00:04:13,513 --> 00:04:15,429
I have seen apparitions.

68
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,110
I could go on and on.

69
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:19,319
Okay. Is it affecting business?

70
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,138
It is.

71
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:24,727
I have my entire life savings into this,
not to mention blood, sweat, and tears.

72
00:04:24,728 --> 00:04:28,315
And I just honestly need to do
something about it, whatever it is.

73
00:04:28,316 --> 00:04:30,308
Now, do you know any
history about this building?

74
00:04:30,309 --> 00:04:32,376
It's the oldest restaurant in Seattle.

75
00:04:32,377 --> 00:04:35,266
It was built in 1890,
and this is approximately,

76
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:40,078
a year after the great fire that
completely devastated Seattle.

77
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,214
Okay well, how about previous
owners, you ever talk to them?

78
00:04:43,215 --> 00:04:48,216
The only thing I really know is there
were seven owners in the last eight years.

79
00:04:48,217 --> 00:04:52,367
And I can't afford to be
the eighth in nine years.

80
00:04:52,368 --> 00:04:55,068
I can't do it.

81
00:04:58,906 --> 00:05:01,598
A regular person who
spends a lot of time here...

82
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:04,274
They're gonna see some [Bleep].

83
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:07,503
They're gonna feel stuff.
They're gonna hear stuff.

84
00:05:07,504 --> 00:05:11,956
If they're sensitive,
they're gonna be messed up.

85
00:05:11,957 --> 00:05:14,302
I can't remember the
last place I've been,

86
00:05:14,303 --> 00:05:16,698
that's had this many conscious entities.

87
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:18,427
All of them are trying to talk to me,

88
00:05:18,428 --> 00:05:21,218
trying to share how they
died at the same time.

89
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:26,079
But there's one who
stands out from the rest.

90
00:05:32,697 --> 00:05:35,408
Uh, there's a guy here.

91
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:37,368
He looks real bad.

92
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:39,974
Some of his face is missing.

93
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:43,640
He doesn't like to be interfered with.

94
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:46,352
His rules still apply.

95
00:05:46,353 --> 00:05:50,013
And he likes to enforce them.

96
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:56,493
He makes me nervous.

97
00:05:57,281 --> 00:06:00,521
He makes me feel agony.

98
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,701
Darcy, why'd you bring me to this spot?

99
00:06:10,702 --> 00:06:15,672
One night at closing, my manager
was here, and we were arguing.

100
00:06:15,673 --> 00:06:17,408
And it just got misty.

101
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:19,266
And I said, "Tony, turn around".

102
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:22,076
"Does it look misty to you over there?"

103
00:06:22,077 --> 00:06:25,015
And he goes, "yeah. Let's go".

104
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:26,137
Like a fog?

105
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:28,619
- Like fog.
- That's strange.

106
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,886
Anything else up here?

107
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:34,046
One night I closed up, and the next
morning all the wine was literally,

108
00:06:34,047 --> 00:06:39,320
thrown from this wine rack all the
way across the floor and broken.

109
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:40,397
Every bottle?

110
00:06:40,398 --> 00:06:42,858
Every bottle.

111
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,782
And this was intact, this
didn't fall down or anything?

112
00:06:45,783 --> 00:06:48,020
- No, it did not.
- Were you broken into?

113
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:49,821
No.

114
00:06:54,445 --> 00:06:57,812
This guy will not be quiet.

115
00:06:57,813 --> 00:07:01,918
Well, I feel like if he's
being in a particularly...

116
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,459
Angry mood, you'd feel him.

117
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:09,100
And he moves a lot of
things all the time.

118
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:10,743
Like what?

119
00:07:10,744 --> 00:07:15,244
I don't know, just stuff around the bar.

120
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:20,087
It's weird, because he
doesn't want to be here.

121
00:07:20,088 --> 00:07:23,628
This isn't working for him.

122
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:31,488
Why'd you bring me down here?

123
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:34,529
One of my guests came
downstairs, a woman...

124
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,760
Maybe in her 50s.

125
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:38,539
When she got to the last step...

126
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:44,255
She says that she feels like she
was pushed down the stairs from here.

127
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:45,377
Wow.

128
00:07:45,378 --> 00:07:48,457
And a man was coming out of
the bathroom and witnessed her,

129
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:53,664
and he said she actually went forward
from the top like she was pushed.

130
00:07:53,665 --> 00:07:56,123
- Was she drunk?
- Not at all.

131
00:07:56,124 --> 00:07:58,044
Okay.

132
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:06,464
This guy whose face is missing...

133
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:12,894
He doesn't want us to invade his space.

134
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,840
What happens when someone does?

135
00:08:22,645 --> 00:08:25,756
He's, like, push, get
the [Bleep] out of my way.

136
00:08:25,757 --> 00:08:27,453
Is it dangerous?

137
00:08:27,454 --> 00:08:31,354
He will throw people down stairs.

138
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:39,738
Definitely wanted to
throw me down the stairs.

139
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:47,532
I've had a number of
customers that say that,

140
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:51,074
they see a woman go into the
bathroom and shut the door.

141
00:08:51,075 --> 00:08:55,359
So they'll wait, wait, and then finally
when it seems to have taken too long,

142
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,419
they'll kind of push the door open.

143
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,780
And they go in and there's nobody there.

144
00:09:02,781 --> 00:09:06,070
A lot of them will just ask
for their check and leave.

145
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:08,561
Your employees, how do they
feel about coming down here?

146
00:09:08,562 --> 00:09:10,069
They're uncomfortable.

147
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,585
You're having trouble
keeping customers, obviously.

148
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:16,201
Your employees are a little freaked out. I
mean, how are you dealing with all of this?

149
00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:17,701
Not well.

150
00:09:17,702 --> 00:09:19,507
I left here on a Friday night.

151
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:22,344
I was so sick, like,
really, really sick.

152
00:09:22,345 --> 00:09:24,737
So Monday morning I went to the doctor,

153
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:28,054
and I had bacterial
pneumonia in my right lung,

154
00:09:28,055 --> 00:09:31,697
which had got into my bloodstream.

155
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:35,488
I actually was in the hospital
for five days in a row.

156
00:09:35,489 --> 00:09:40,860
They can't figure out how I got
that sick that fast when I'm healthy.

157
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:42,695
How serious did it get?

158
00:09:42,696 --> 00:09:45,561
You know, I didn't actually even
know if I was gonna live through it.

159
00:09:45,562 --> 00:09:48,940
It was as serious as it could be.

160
00:09:48,941 --> 00:09:50,861
Okay.

161
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:57,807
There's this religious woman.

162
00:10:01,582 --> 00:10:05,422
And she's, like, always praying.

163
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:10,819
I think that living
people, they see her.

164
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,827
But, like, she's really a very dark...

165
00:10:14,828 --> 00:10:17,228
Dark person.

166
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:19,979
I don't like her.

167
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,154
She creeps me out.

168
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:24,975
She's, uh, scary.

169
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,030
She like, picks people.

170
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:32,359
What do you mean?

171
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,164
She picks the weak.

172
00:10:34,165 --> 00:10:36,802
She picks the weak.

173
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,083
Uh, women.

174
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,219
Sickly people.

175
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,648
And then what does she do?

176
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:48,429
I think she [Bleep] kills them.

177
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:01,322
This religious woman, she feels
women are weak and the sickly.

178
00:11:01,323 --> 00:11:03,541
What does she do?

179
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:07,322
I think she [Bleep] kills them.

180
00:11:07,713 --> 00:11:10,315
How does she do that?

181
00:11:10,316 --> 00:11:12,896
It's a touch.

182
00:11:13,162 --> 00:11:15,922
They [Bleep] die.

183
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:19,934
Do you get a name on her?

184
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,855
Mary.

185
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:30,454
So, Matt, how long
you been working here?

186
00:11:30,455 --> 00:11:32,504
- About a year and a half now.
- Okay.

187
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:33,805
Do you ever work downstairs?

188
00:11:33,806 --> 00:11:35,197
I never work downstairs.

189
00:11:35,198 --> 00:11:37,594
This is my first time
down here in over a year.

190
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:40,561
Why don't you tell me what's going
on? What have you experienced?

191
00:11:40,562 --> 00:11:41,768
I'd come down here,

192
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:45,059
with a glass very similar to the
one that's right here on the bar.

193
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,094
I put the glass down,
just as you see now.

194
00:11:47,095 --> 00:11:47,806
Okay.

195
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:51,760
I made my way around the
back side of the bar here.

196
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:53,906
When I came back, I
reached for my glass,

197
00:11:53,907 --> 00:11:57,236
and it slid about four
feet, and all I saw was it,

198
00:11:57,237 --> 00:12:00,139
hitting the lip and going over the edge.

199
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,625
Hearing the actual smash.

200
00:12:01,626 --> 00:12:05,628
And I mean, that sound is something that
I'm not gonna forget for a long time.

201
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:10,953
Now, if walked away and I left you
here, would you be freaking out?

202
00:12:10,954 --> 00:12:12,935
And it just took that
one incident for you.

203
00:12:12,936 --> 00:12:14,491
That's all it took.

204
00:12:14,492 --> 00:12:17,343
Made me a believer.

205
00:12:17,344 --> 00:12:21,213
Does it hurt you financially
because you won't work downstairs?

206
00:12:21,214 --> 00:12:24,286
It would help if I was able to
get down here and get some shifts.

207
00:12:24,287 --> 00:12:26,907
Um, as long as things get
straightened out first.

208
00:12:26,908 --> 00:12:29,015
Well, hopefully we'll
get some answers and,

209
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:32,492
maybe Amy can come up with a solution
and you can maybe start working down here.

210
00:12:32,493 --> 00:12:34,773
Absolutely.

211
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,146
So, this is his space, so...

212
00:12:39,147 --> 00:12:42,927
He's angry... very, very
angry. He's throwing a fit.

213
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:47,128
And, you know, he moves a
lot of things all the time.

214
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:50,549
He is not a happy camper.

215
00:12:51,424 --> 00:12:53,258
The angry man and the religious woman,

216
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:56,129
seem to be the most powerful
entities in this building.

217
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,981
But there are dozens of other
dead trying to get my attention.

218
00:12:58,982 --> 00:13:01,111
And it's making me physically ill.

219
00:13:01,112 --> 00:13:04,606
I'm experiencing a lot
of other people's deaths.

220
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:07,886
- How many?
- Probably about 20 or 30.

221
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,167
30 people.

222
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:12,923
I'm going through their deaths.

223
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:15,451
One, two, three, four. So...

224
00:13:15,452 --> 00:13:17,824
Why do you think there's so many?

225
00:13:17,825 --> 00:13:19,650
Lots of...

226
00:13:19,651 --> 00:13:21,691
Layers.

227
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:25,339
So much has happened.

228
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,400
So much has happened.

229
00:13:33,576 --> 00:13:35,545
Dillon, have you ever
experienced anything here?

230
00:13:35,546 --> 00:13:38,463
Yeah, I've actually got
a gentlemen that has uh,

231
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:40,425
showed himself to me
here in the kitchen.

232
00:13:40,426 --> 00:13:43,609
He's probably showed himself
about a dozen times or so.

233
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,102
Okay, can you describe him?

234
00:13:45,103 --> 00:13:48,766
He's an older gentleman, about 5'8".

235
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:51,476
Wears a button-up shirt,
double-breasted jacket.

236
00:13:51,477 --> 00:13:53,831
Okay, would you say
he's from a time period?

237
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:59,049
I would say anywhere from
late 1800s to early 1920s.

238
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,832
He's actually starting
to follow me around now.

239
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:05,013
- You're kidding.
- No.

240
00:14:06,277 --> 00:14:10,651
I feel like people could
see him... the angry man.

241
00:14:10,652 --> 00:14:14,715
He's wearing, like, a dark,
burgundy, button-down shirt.

242
00:14:14,716 --> 00:14:18,455
And he's probably about your height.

243
00:14:18,456 --> 00:14:21,535
He had to enforce his rules.

244
00:14:21,536 --> 00:14:27,436
If somebody [Bleep] with him, he's the one
who's gonna put a knife in their throat.

245
00:14:28,455 --> 00:14:33,135
Yeah, he knows how to
take care of himself.

246
00:14:38,885 --> 00:14:40,665
Okay, Dillon, what happened in here?

247
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,539
The bartender upstairs...

248
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,050
She comes downstairs to check what
specials I'm gonna run for the day.

249
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:49,403
Seconds after she gets to
the bottom of the stairs,

250
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:52,318
60-gallon garbage can...
bang! Bang! Bang!...

251
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:54,909
Came down the stairs after her.

252
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,430
Misses her by a couple feet.

253
00:14:57,431 --> 00:15:00,667
If the spirit could push a
garbage can down the stairs,

254
00:15:00,668 --> 00:15:03,432
who's to say it couldn't push
a human down the stairs or,

255
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:07,693
pick up a knife and throw it at you?

256
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:12,409
I see these little creature things.

257
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:14,806
What are they, then?

258
00:15:14,807 --> 00:15:17,872
I don't... I can't really
tell because they're all...

259
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:21,293
Kind of messed-up-looking.

260
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:25,524
They, like, scurry on the floor.

261
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,218
Almost like crabs.

262
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:29,655
But they're black and
they're kind of fast.

263
00:15:29,656 --> 00:15:31,444
So, what do they do?

264
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:34,745
They, like, stalk people.

265
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:39,828
I can feel them touching, grabbing.

266
00:15:40,277 --> 00:15:45,437
Your whole body reacts,
like, you get those chills.

267
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,521
Ugh.

268
00:15:47,522 --> 00:15:50,378
- You all right?
- One grabbed my leg.

269
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:52,659
That hurt.

270
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:04,554
There's these things.

271
00:16:09,363 --> 00:16:10,472
Oof!

272
00:16:10,473 --> 00:16:13,773
They, like, stalk people.

273
00:16:15,694 --> 00:16:19,594
And people do see them for sure.

274
00:16:19,721 --> 00:16:21,129
What would that look like?

275
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,833
They could look like
little child-size mists.

276
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:27,654
Vengeful, little...

277
00:16:28,406 --> 00:16:30,926
Nasty [Bleep].

278
00:16:40,014 --> 00:16:42,257
Darcy told me that her
restaurant was built

279
00:16:42,258 --> 00:16:46,841
right after a devastating
fire in the late 1800s.

280
00:16:46,842 --> 00:16:48,951
I'm on my way to meet
a local fire historian,

281
00:16:48,952 --> 00:16:54,852
who says it was part of one of the
greatest disasters in Seattle's history.

282
00:17:00,597 --> 00:17:04,815
The two-story wooden structure
that originally was on that site,

283
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:08,795
was burned during the great
Seattle fire of June 6, 1889.

284
00:17:08,796 --> 00:17:11,064
- How big of a fire was it?
- It was a huge fire.

285
00:17:11,065 --> 00:17:14,308
It burned almost the
entire commercial district.

286
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:19,533
This is a picture taken of
the aftermath of the fire.

287
00:17:19,534 --> 00:17:22,216
Wow, it actually looks like a war zone.

288
00:17:22,217 --> 00:17:24,352
Now, did anybody die in this fire?

289
00:17:24,353 --> 00:17:25,519
Yes.

290
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,662
A young boy died in the fire,

291
00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:31,930
and after the fire with
these tall walls of brick,

292
00:17:31,931 --> 00:17:36,951
there was this one wall that came
down and ended up killing a gentleman.

293
00:17:36,952 --> 00:17:40,006
Were there any other fires in
or around the Merchants Café?

294
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:43,850
The only other one that I
know of took place in 1885.

295
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:46,918
Within a block of the Merchants Café.

296
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,371
It was a huge fire where two
people did lose their life.

297
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:53,292
Okay.

298
00:18:02,405 --> 00:18:07,690
Before this building was here, there was
another structure here that was smaller.

299
00:18:07,691 --> 00:18:11,615
Awful things happened there. I
think it burned down a few times.

300
00:18:11,616 --> 00:18:14,195
So, these floor things... that's them?

301
00:18:14,196 --> 00:18:17,554
Yeah. They died in a fire.

302
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:21,292
They're all burned.
They're all nasty. It's bad.

303
00:18:21,293 --> 00:18:24,708
These strange creatures keep
communicating the word "fire" to me.

304
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:27,263
And they're really angry about it.

305
00:18:27,264 --> 00:18:32,784
They were trapped or stuck,
like they couldn't get out.

306
00:18:34,972 --> 00:18:40,792
And they're very bent on revenge
for what happened to them.

307
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:46,303
When they get to know the person
that they're gonna mess with.

308
00:18:46,304 --> 00:18:48,583
They learn everything about them.

309
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:53,455
They are stalkers, like, they hone in,
and they're, like, preying on the weak.

310
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:57,416
And they'll go after that person.

311
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,699
Now that I know the structure I'm
investigating burned to the ground.

312
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,818
I need to find out who rebuilt it.

313
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:09,345
A local historian has
agreed to meet me downtown,

314
00:19:09,346 --> 00:19:14,986
and he says the Merchants
Café has a very colorful past.

315
00:19:26,106 --> 00:19:30,743
I understand the original building was
burned down in 1889 during the fires.

316
00:19:30,744 --> 00:19:32,612
How did it get rebuilt?

317
00:19:32,613 --> 00:19:34,415
It was rebuilt in 1890,

318
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:37,599
as the four-story Victorian
structure that you see today.

319
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,097
One of the first owners
was a man named John Ossner,

320
00:19:40,098 --> 00:19:43,055
who opened the Merchants
Exchange Saloon in the basement.

321
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,157
Okay, now, what did
Ossner do with the place?

322
00:19:45,158 --> 00:19:49,924
Well, in the panic of 1893 when
the economy was just devastated.

323
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:53,132
Ossner got desperate for revenue
and decided that he would take

324
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:56,748
what was now the basement and
turn it into an illegal card room.

325
00:19:56,749 --> 00:20:00,650
And then the upstairs
hotel became a brothel.

326
00:20:00,651 --> 00:20:03,342
Okay, so we had a gambling parlor,
we had the bar, and a brothel.

327
00:20:03,343 --> 00:20:05,863
That's right.

328
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:12,351
When I walked in, I
saw this different...

329
00:20:12,352 --> 00:20:16,155
There were people, lots and lots of
people laughing and having a good time.

330
00:20:16,156 --> 00:20:22,056
And there were prostitutes but
dressed nice, like, old-fashioned.

331
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:24,068
Any idea when?

332
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:27,129
1880s. I don't know.

333
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:32,291
There was really frickin' bad people.

334
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:38,112
Get bad people in a bad place,
bad things are gonna happen.

335
00:20:39,523 --> 00:20:42,230
So, did Ossner run it the entire time?

336
00:20:42,231 --> 00:20:45,466
No, in 1898, right after the gold rush,

337
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:49,928
they sold a big portion of the business
to a fellow named F.X. Schreiner.

338
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:52,933
Schreiner's wife,
Mary, was not approving.

339
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:57,307
She was a very devout woman,
had gone to convent school.

340
00:20:57,308 --> 00:21:00,974
She definitely had an image to keep.

341
00:21:00,975 --> 00:21:03,114
She died in 1905.

342
00:21:03,115 --> 00:21:04,715
Now, do you know what she died of?

343
00:21:04,716 --> 00:21:07,873
She died of consumption, or
what we call Tuberculosis today.

344
00:21:07,874 --> 00:21:10,288
It came on rather suddenly.

345
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:14,018
He was heartbroken and went back
to Germany for a period of time.

346
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:16,662
What happened to the business when
Schreiner went back to Germany?

347
00:21:16,663 --> 00:21:22,563
The other partners brought in a new
bartender by the name of Otto Hink.

348
00:21:23,898 --> 00:21:25,468
What is he, a bodybuilder or something?

349
00:21:25,469 --> 00:21:29,530
He was a wrestler, actually,
and he became the barkeeper.

350
00:21:29,531 --> 00:21:31,209
So what else can you tell me about him?

351
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,918
He had a wife and children in town,

352
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,026
but he also had a habit of
frequenting the brothels himself.

353
00:21:38,027 --> 00:21:41,638
And so the party for
him was over at age 42.

354
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:45,432
Because he had already
contracted syphilis of the brain,

355
00:21:45,433 --> 00:21:47,662
and he began to have dementia.

356
00:21:47,663 --> 00:21:51,755
He ended up being committed to various
mental hospitals throughout the state,

357
00:21:51,756 --> 00:21:56,101
and lived in sanitariums
for the rest of his life.

358
00:21:56,102 --> 00:21:58,141
We have the certificate of death,

359
00:21:58,142 --> 00:22:01,425
and you see that he
did not die until 1957.

360
00:22:01,426 --> 00:22:03,761
At age 79.

361
00:22:03,762 --> 00:22:08,322
It was a very long
and excruciating death.

362
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:19,467
Mm.

363
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,619
He's very, very, very physical.

364
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:28,520
Like, I see iron fists ran this
place with, like, an iron fist.

365
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:31,733
This angry man is in so much agony.

366
00:22:31,734 --> 00:22:35,750
He keeps pulling me back to the
upstairs bar to try and share his pain.

367
00:22:35,751 --> 00:22:38,540
Something about a child or children.

368
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:42,206
And he wants to take
care of them but can't.

369
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:46,167
Doesn't understand where they are.

370
00:22:46,589 --> 00:22:50,085
He's, like, a pretty buff guy.

371
00:22:50,086 --> 00:22:52,428
Like, he fought a lot.

372
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:55,006
He's angry, confused...

373
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:57,647
Hurt, and he...

374
00:22:58,523 --> 00:23:02,603
Doesn't understand what's happening.

375
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:17,391
So far, I know that the
Merchants Café was a brothel,

376
00:23:17,392 --> 00:23:20,291
and burned to the
ground in a deadly fire.

377
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:23,317
But a place that old
has to have more secrets.

378
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:27,837
So I'm at the library, seeing
what else I can uncover.

379
00:23:27,838 --> 00:23:31,178
Digging through the archives, I
was shocked to discover not one,

380
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:34,296
but two executions happened
directly across the street,

381
00:23:34,297 --> 00:23:38,377
from the location I'm investigating.

382
00:23:41,873 --> 00:23:43,774
I'm on my way to meet a Seattle cop,

383
00:23:43,775 --> 00:23:47,777
who studied the executions across
the street from Merchants Café.

384
00:23:47,778 --> 00:23:53,678
He says he's got information
that will definitely help my case.

385
00:24:00,235 --> 00:24:02,867
Jim, I read an article where
it said in the late 1800s,

386
00:24:02,868 --> 00:24:05,922
there was a lynch mob
that grabbed two guys.

387
00:24:05,923 --> 00:24:07,147
And they hung them.

388
00:24:07,148 --> 00:24:10,274
Uh, it looks like right across the
street from a property I'm investigating.

389
00:24:10,275 --> 00:24:11,393
That's correct.

390
00:24:11,394 --> 00:24:14,426
On the 18th of January, 1882,

391
00:24:14,427 --> 00:24:16,672
two murder suspects
were being arraigned.

392
00:24:16,673 --> 00:24:19,501
They were alleged to have
murdered a prominent businessman.

393
00:24:19,502 --> 00:24:22,338
Uh, George Reynolds, the previous night.

394
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:25,261
At 9:30 in the morning,
they were arraigned.

395
00:24:25,262 --> 00:24:29,935
By 1:00, the Judge had determined there
was enough evidence to commit them...

396
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:32,046
- To be held over for the grand jury.
- Okay.

397
00:24:32,047 --> 00:24:35,181
At which point a lynch mob formed.

398
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,395
They overpowered the
two police officers,

399
00:24:37,396 --> 00:24:40,271
took the two suspects
down to Occidental Square.

400
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:41,389
Okay.

401
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:44,753
Here's a photograph of the
sketch that was done at the time.

402
00:24:44,754 --> 00:24:49,204
They put a rope around each one of their
neck, and the crowd started pulling.

403
00:24:49,205 --> 00:24:52,232
It was a particularly gruesome
scene. It was not actually a hanging.

404
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:53,966
It was a strangulation death.

405
00:24:53,967 --> 00:24:56,077
The crowd would yank
on these ropes so hard,

406
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,933
that the suspects' heads
would bounce off the beam.

407
00:24:58,934 --> 00:25:04,106
And they would basically stay there
until they had strangled to death.

408
00:25:04,107 --> 00:25:05,930
It was a very painful, slow death.

409
00:25:05,931 --> 00:25:11,691
It may have taken them up to
five minutes or more to die.

410
00:25:15,732 --> 00:25:19,139
We have these two guys who
were murdered or something.

411
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,107
Or executed, I don't know.
They're [Bleep] criminals.

412
00:25:22,108 --> 00:25:25,126
These guys, too. I think
they're [Bleep] criminals, too.

413
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:29,172
I think they're bad people.
All these people are not good.

414
00:25:29,173 --> 00:25:32,189
And then I see, like, this guy tied up.

415
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,486
And then the other guy next to him,

416
00:25:34,487 --> 00:25:38,244
is like tied up, too,
but he's just dead, dead.

417
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,329
Like, he's asleep dead.

418
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,970
Like a coma for a dead person, okay?

419
00:25:43,971 --> 00:25:48,318
So, I can't distinguish
if cops killed him.

420
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:49,806
There's no justice.

421
00:25:49,807 --> 00:25:54,067
I'm getting like, there's no justice.

422
00:25:55,044 --> 00:25:56,625
Three people here, though.

423
00:25:56,626 --> 00:26:00,766
There is three people. Shortly after this
happened, the crowd went down to the jail,

424
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,793
broke down the door,
overpowered the Sheriff.

425
00:26:03,794 --> 00:26:05,886
And pulled out another suspect,

426
00:26:05,887 --> 00:26:09,848
who was waiting to be heard on charges
of killing one of our police officers.

427
00:26:09,849 --> 00:26:13,110
They dragged him down to the gallows.

428
00:26:13,111 --> 00:26:16,141
The last thing he saw was
the two corpses hanging,

429
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:19,820
on the beam, faces
blue, tongues swollen.

430
00:26:19,821 --> 00:26:22,356
And he realized he
would be the next to die.

431
00:26:22,357 --> 00:26:24,009
Right before they hung him up, he said,

432
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,185
"if you hang me, you're
hanging an innocent man".

433
00:26:26,186 --> 00:26:29,897
At which point, the crowd strung him
up the same as they did the other two.

434
00:26:29,898 --> 00:26:32,274
So, what's the story? Was he
innocent? Was he... you know?

435
00:26:32,275 --> 00:26:34,879
Well, based on our research, he
very well may have been innocent.

436
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,745
The officer that he shot,

437
00:26:36,746 --> 00:26:39,431
was in plain clothes chasing
him down the street with a gun.

438
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:41,661
He thought the officer may
have been a robbery suspect,

439
00:26:41,662 --> 00:26:43,553
so he turned and fired his own gun,

440
00:26:43,554 --> 00:26:46,930
since many people carried
their own pistols back then.

441
00:26:46,931 --> 00:26:49,697
Before the officer died
that night, he said that,

442
00:26:49,698 --> 00:26:53,182
the suspect may have not been
aware that he was a police officer,

443
00:26:53,183 --> 00:26:56,964
and so he may have inadvertently
been just defending himself.

444
00:26:56,965 --> 00:27:01,165
- And they hung him.
- They hung him.

445
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,259
During my walk, I encountered
dozens of dead people.

446
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,579
But the angry and confused
man stood out above them all.

447
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,180
Some of his face is missing.

448
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:25,727
He had a hat and kind of rolls under.

449
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:29,314
There was, like, a scar here.

450
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:30,153
Mm-hmm.

451
00:27:30,154 --> 00:27:32,337
And it's almost like...

452
00:27:32,338 --> 00:27:34,438
A hole.

453
00:27:34,601 --> 00:27:36,959
Did you get a feel that
he's from the present time?

454
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,560
Oh, no. He's from way back.

455
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:45,490
Amy, is this who you saw?

456
00:27:48,436 --> 00:27:50,296
Yes.

457
00:28:09,845 --> 00:28:11,675
Now that Amy and I are finished,

458
00:28:11,676 --> 00:28:14,391
with our investigations
of Darcy's property.

459
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,899
We're ready to reveal what we've found.

460
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,969
Darcy bought this place
about a year and a half ago.

461
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,871
She never believed in
the paranormal at all.

462
00:28:22,872 --> 00:28:24,706
Then she started working here.

463
00:28:24,707 --> 00:28:27,042
She actually ran out of here
three times, scared to death.

464
00:28:27,043 --> 00:28:28,882
She's afraid of losing her employees.

465
00:28:28,883 --> 00:28:30,677
She's losing business.

466
00:28:30,678 --> 00:28:32,044
Matt works here.

467
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:34,835
Matt's so afraid to go
downstairs, he's losing shifts.

468
00:28:34,836 --> 00:28:37,504
It's one of these things
that's eating at him.

469
00:28:37,505 --> 00:28:39,325
So with that, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy,

470
00:28:39,326 --> 00:28:44,611
and she's gonna tell us a
little bit about her walk.

471
00:28:44,612 --> 00:28:46,157
Well, the first thing that I...

472
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:48,556
The first thing that I
really want to say is that,

473
00:28:48,557 --> 00:28:50,517
this is a very difficult walk.

474
00:28:50,518 --> 00:28:53,334
Because there are a lot of dead.

475
00:28:53,335 --> 00:28:54,951
Like 30 people.

476
00:28:54,952 --> 00:28:56,711
It was pretty chaotic.

477
00:28:56,712 --> 00:28:59,333
And so I went downstairs,

478
00:28:59,334 --> 00:29:03,039
saw these two men that were executed,

479
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,388
and whoever killed them tortured them.

480
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:08,417
Like, they were tied up.

481
00:29:08,418 --> 00:29:11,865
And the other thing that was really
strange was I kept hearing somebody say...

482
00:29:11,866 --> 00:29:13,505
"There was no justice".

483
00:29:13,506 --> 00:29:18,192
And that it had something
to do with the police.

484
00:29:18,193 --> 00:29:22,252
I mean, she almost nailed this
down to what really happened here.

485
00:29:22,253 --> 00:29:27,255
Back in the late 1800s, there was
two men that murdered a merchant.

486
00:29:27,256 --> 00:29:31,533
They put him in jail, they got arraigned
the next day, but a mob took over.

487
00:29:31,534 --> 00:29:33,917
And they went and they
grabbed these two guys,

488
00:29:33,918 --> 00:29:36,892
and literally about
200 feet from here...

489
00:29:36,893 --> 00:29:39,812
They made a makeshift gallows.

490
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:42,269
And they strung them up.

491
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:45,434
Now, these guys were not
hung in the normal fashion.

492
00:29:45,435 --> 00:29:48,201
Basically, they would pull them up.

493
00:29:48,202 --> 00:29:49,386
Oh, my God.

494
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:52,880
They kept pulling them up
till their heads hit the top.

495
00:29:52,881 --> 00:29:55,648
So these guys were struggling.

496
00:29:55,649 --> 00:29:58,050
Now, you see there's a third guy?

497
00:29:58,051 --> 00:30:01,780
This guy had been in jail for about a
month for murdering a police officer.

498
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:05,057
So they went and got him,
and they strung him up.

499
00:30:05,058 --> 00:30:08,777
Thing is, he might've
been an innocent man.

500
00:30:08,778 --> 00:30:10,520
Wow.

501
00:30:10,521 --> 00:30:13,268
First time I've ever heard of this.

502
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:16,329
It's pretty gruesome.

503
00:30:19,249 --> 00:30:21,888
So, what else did you see on your walk?

504
00:30:21,889 --> 00:30:25,256
I felt like this was a
really bad area at one time.

505
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:28,590
But I got in here, parties...

506
00:30:28,591 --> 00:30:30,898
And dancing and uh...

507
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:32,969
Prostitutes.

508
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,566
What time period are you talking about?

509
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:37,039
It was, like, the 1880s.

510
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,773
People were very well-dressed in here.

511
00:30:40,774 --> 00:30:43,144
Well, during my research, I came across,

512
00:30:43,145 --> 00:30:47,299
a guy by the name of F.X.
Schreiner who owned the place.

513
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:52,580
There's a picture of him...
this is F.X. Schreiner.

514
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:55,923
He ran downstairs as a gambling parlor.

515
00:30:55,924 --> 00:30:58,199
Up here was the booze.

516
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,735
And then there was a brothel upstairs.

517
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:03,165
He had a lot of people
coming through here,

518
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:05,874
to indulge in seedy
things that were going on.

519
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:08,215
Interesting.

520
00:31:08,482 --> 00:31:10,645
How'd the rest of the walk go?

521
00:31:10,646 --> 00:31:14,939
So, I'm downstairs, and
I'm by the bathrooms...

522
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,240
And this lady comes out.

523
00:31:18,762 --> 00:31:21,067
She was really, really religious.

524
00:31:21,068 --> 00:31:23,752
And uh, she's very solid.

525
00:31:23,753 --> 00:31:27,893
Which means she has a lot of power.

526
00:31:27,906 --> 00:31:30,216
I felt like people could see her.

527
00:31:30,217 --> 00:31:32,151
I don't like her very much.

528
00:31:32,152 --> 00:31:34,972
Her name is Mary.

529
00:31:35,069 --> 00:31:38,310
She can make contact with people.

530
00:31:38,311 --> 00:31:41,142
She'll just poke or tap.

531
00:31:41,143 --> 00:31:45,523
And she goes after people who are weak.

532
00:31:45,882 --> 00:31:51,762
Like older people, sick people,
children, and especially women.

533
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:58,080
And when she touches people,
it's like a death sentence.

534
00:32:00,228 --> 00:32:03,348
Well, I don't want to die.

535
00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:06,176
Why don't you tell Amy about,

536
00:32:06,177 --> 00:32:09,665
some of your customers and what
they've seen down in the bathroom.

537
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:12,063
Four different times that I know of,

538
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:15,767
people go downstairs and have
seen a woman go in the bathroom,

539
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:18,062
and there's nobody in the bathroom.

540
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:21,865
People have come upstairs after that
and asked for their check and left.

541
00:32:21,866 --> 00:32:23,226
Wow.

542
00:32:23,227 --> 00:32:25,040
Now, you said her name was Mary?

543
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:25,915
Yes.

544
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:27,851
The wife of F.X. Schreiner...

545
00:32:27,852 --> 00:32:29,940
She was a very pious, religious woman...

546
00:32:29,941 --> 00:32:34,937
Didn't like the fact that her husband
was making money with prostitutes.

547
00:32:34,938 --> 00:32:36,992
She wanted to be on
the high end of society.

548
00:32:36,993 --> 00:32:39,873
Her name was Mary.

549
00:32:39,996 --> 00:32:42,742
This is a picture of her.

550
00:32:42,743 --> 00:32:47,959
Do you think the woman you
saw is this Mary Schreiner?

551
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,820
Yes.

552
00:32:58,086 --> 00:33:00,011
What else you wind up
seeing on your walk?

553
00:33:00,012 --> 00:33:03,488
I was up here, and I met...

554
00:33:03,489 --> 00:33:07,007
A really, really interesting
guy behind the bar.

555
00:33:07,008 --> 00:33:10,330
And he was very forceful.

556
00:33:10,331 --> 00:33:12,714
Also very physical.

557
00:33:12,715 --> 00:33:18,143
He probably ran this place and
ran it with, like, an iron fist.

558
00:33:18,144 --> 00:33:22,267
But he's very confused
about what's happening.

559
00:33:22,268 --> 00:33:24,614
It's really sad.

560
00:33:24,615 --> 00:33:29,581
He also felt that he wanted
to take care of a child...

561
00:33:29,582 --> 00:33:32,448
His child... but he can't.

562
00:33:32,449 --> 00:33:34,999
Let me tell you about
a guy named Otto Hink.

563
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,695
When Mary died, F.X.
Schreiner decided to go back

564
00:33:38,696 --> 00:33:40,949
to Germany with his
kids for a little while.

565
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:43,261
And Otto Hink took
over running the place.

566
00:33:43,262 --> 00:33:46,982
He was a wrestler. Strong guy.

567
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:50,635
You know, he was the
bouncer. He was the bar guy.

568
00:33:50,636 --> 00:33:52,393
You said he was confused, right?

569
00:33:52,394 --> 00:33:54,224
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

570
00:33:54,225 --> 00:33:56,865
He liked to visit the brothel himself.

571
00:33:56,866 --> 00:34:00,718
Apparently, he contracted
syphilis of the brain.

572
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:05,187
So at a young age... 42... he
started going a little mental.

573
00:34:05,188 --> 00:34:06,300
Wow.

574
00:34:06,301 --> 00:34:09,648
He spent 37 years in
mental asylums till he died,

575
00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:11,059
- at the age of 79.
- Oh, my gosh.

576
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,692
Are you kidding me?

577
00:34:12,693 --> 00:34:14,372
It's kind of like dementia.

578
00:34:14,373 --> 00:34:20,133
He was obviously in no condition
to take care of his kids.

579
00:34:20,506 --> 00:34:22,480
He's very, very territorial.

580
00:34:22,481 --> 00:34:26,644
Especially about the
bar area, and back there.

581
00:34:26,645 --> 00:34:28,888
He's very protective of his space.

582
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:33,017
And if you get in his way, he
can push you out of the way.

583
00:34:33,018 --> 00:34:35,432
Tell Amy what happened.

584
00:34:35,433 --> 00:34:38,416
I went downstairs, and
I put a glass on the bar,

585
00:34:38,417 --> 00:34:40,720
and the glass actually slid off,

586
00:34:40,721 --> 00:34:44,317
the opposite side of the bar
and smashed on the ground.

587
00:34:44,318 --> 00:34:46,645
One night, I closed,

588
00:34:46,646 --> 00:34:50,047
and the next morning, he opened,

589
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:54,316
and every bottle of wine had
been thrown out of the wine rack,

590
00:34:54,317 --> 00:35:00,217
and broken onto the floor with red
wine running out the front door.

591
00:35:00,221 --> 00:35:02,023
Wow.

592
00:35:02,024 --> 00:35:04,246
Your chef, Dillon...

593
00:35:04,247 --> 00:35:07,152
He's seen a guy...

594
00:35:07,153 --> 00:35:10,081
Like 15 times downstairs.

595
00:35:10,082 --> 00:35:13,380
Do you think the guy
you saw is Otto Hink?

596
00:35:13,381 --> 00:35:15,631
I think it's very likely.

597
00:35:15,632 --> 00:35:19,232
I did a sketch of this man.

598
00:35:22,735 --> 00:35:24,595
Wow.

599
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,236
[Bleep].

600
00:35:26,237 --> 00:35:28,697
What's that?

601
00:35:41,489 --> 00:35:44,691
Do you think the guy
you saw is Otto Hink?

602
00:35:44,692 --> 00:35:48,112
I think it's very likely.

603
00:35:59,467 --> 00:36:00,654
[Bleep].

604
00:36:00,655 --> 00:36:03,115
What's that?

605
00:36:03,311 --> 00:36:04,896
What's with the face?

606
00:36:04,897 --> 00:36:06,255
It was an injury.

607
00:36:06,256 --> 00:36:10,638
I don't know if he
was shot, stabbed, cut.

608
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:13,107
I mean, it's definitely the same mouth.

609
00:36:13,108 --> 00:36:15,388
Same nose.

610
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:21,053
I don't like him looking at me.

611
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:23,723
It's kind of creepy.

612
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:27,204
I don't like that at all.

613
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:36,039
In the basement, I saw these things.

614
00:36:38,151 --> 00:36:41,971
They don't look like crabs,
but they move like crabs.

615
00:36:41,972 --> 00:36:46,592
They were people, and
they died in a fire.

616
00:36:46,998 --> 00:36:49,366
They were somehow kind of trapped.

617
00:36:49,367 --> 00:36:52,005
They're very angry about that,

618
00:36:52,006 --> 00:36:56,576
and they're very bitter,
and they want revenge.

619
00:36:56,577 --> 00:37:00,512
The people who died in the fire are
filled with so much hatred and vengeance.

620
00:37:00,513 --> 00:37:04,064
That in death, they show
themselves in disturbing ways.

621
00:37:04,065 --> 00:37:09,965
If you were to see them, it would
look like a child-sized black mist.

622
00:37:10,473 --> 00:37:12,605
- You said they died in a fire.
- Yeah.

623
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:14,989
Back in 1889, there
was the big fire here.

624
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:19,275
It was probably the worst
fire in Seattle's history.

625
00:37:19,276 --> 00:37:22,010
It's believed two people died in it.

626
00:37:22,011 --> 00:37:24,899
And four years prior to this one,

627
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,685
about a block away, another
two men died in a fire.

628
00:37:28,686 --> 00:37:30,144
Wow.

629
00:37:30,145 --> 00:37:31,755
You said it was a mist, right?

630
00:37:31,756 --> 00:37:33,856
Uh-huh.

631
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:39,702
One night, I was arguing with
the General Manager up here,

632
00:37:39,703 --> 00:37:41,773
and it just got misty.

633
00:37:41,774 --> 00:37:46,648
Over in the corner, it was dark, like,
where you could not see through it.

634
00:37:46,649 --> 00:37:49,709
And then we ran out.

635
00:37:51,717 --> 00:37:54,672
It's unusual what they can do.

636
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:57,184
They can make people sick.

637
00:37:57,185 --> 00:38:01,489
They can make you feel like
you're getting chills...

638
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,376
Nauseous...

639
00:38:03,377 --> 00:38:05,951
And can't breathe.

640
00:38:05,952 --> 00:38:09,037
2½, 3 weeks ago, I left here,

641
00:38:09,038 --> 00:38:13,593
and by the time I got
home, I was so sick.

642
00:38:13,594 --> 00:38:16,086
I went to the hospital and,

643
00:38:16,087 --> 00:38:20,047
I had pneumonia in my right lung.

644
00:38:20,183 --> 00:38:23,838
Then the bacteria from my pneumonia
had actually got into my bloodstream,

645
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,705
and my blood was infected.

646
00:38:25,706 --> 00:38:26,587
Oh, my gosh.

647
00:38:26,588 --> 00:38:29,629
And I thought I was gonna die.

648
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:32,810
I was a mess. A mess.

649
00:38:38,479 --> 00:38:41,315
So, Darcy, you've seen the
results of the investigation.

650
00:38:41,316 --> 00:38:45,734
You obviously got more than you
bargained for when you bought this place.

651
00:38:45,735 --> 00:38:50,425
The big question is, is it safe
for you, your employees to be here?

652
00:38:50,426 --> 00:38:56,134
To get that critical answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

653
00:38:56,135 --> 00:39:00,339
It's not really safe for
you to be here right now.

654
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:04,480
Definitely don't go in the basement.

655
00:39:04,703 --> 00:39:08,199
There's things you can do...

656
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,431
For the lady.

657
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:12,970
The way to get rid of her is,

658
00:39:12,971 --> 00:39:18,076
to find a medium who has
a background in counseling.

659
00:39:18,077 --> 00:39:22,376
And who also hopefully
is some type of healer.

660
00:39:22,377 --> 00:39:27,222
If it goes well, it'll get
to the point where she leaves.

661
00:39:27,223 --> 00:39:30,651
If the medium isn't making
any headway with her,

662
00:39:30,652 --> 00:39:35,382
then you're going to
have to make her leave.

663
00:39:35,383 --> 00:39:40,243
And that obviously
involves a type of exorcism.

664
00:39:41,542 --> 00:39:47,045
The other thing with that medium
is for her to do a cleansing on you.

665
00:39:47,046 --> 00:39:51,066
So that you won't get sick again.

666
00:39:52,262 --> 00:39:55,802
As far as he's concerned...

667
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:58,516
I think he should stay.

668
00:39:58,517 --> 00:40:00,429
When I first encountered the angry man,

669
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:03,363
he was lashing out, and
it made me really nervous.

670
00:40:03,364 --> 00:40:09,001
But after a while, it became clear he
was only trying to protect this location.

671
00:40:09,002 --> 00:40:10,844
I know you don't want to hear that.

672
00:40:10,845 --> 00:40:16,185
If we can play along well,
then I'm okay with that.

673
00:40:17,714 --> 00:40:19,754
So, what about those creatures?

674
00:40:19,755 --> 00:40:20,845
Uh...

675
00:40:20,846 --> 00:40:25,526
For them, the way that
they died was awful.

676
00:40:25,979 --> 00:40:29,391
And there was no respect there.

677
00:40:29,392 --> 00:40:33,452
I would like them to
have a funeral service.

678
00:40:33,453 --> 00:40:35,640
Followed by a blessing.

679
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:39,999
So, if they get this funeral service
done, will this move these creatures on?

680
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,801
Well, it's part of the process.

681
00:40:41,802 --> 00:40:46,207
So, the funeral and then the blessing.
And that will help to move them on.

682
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:48,980
Who do you think made Darcy sick, then?

683
00:40:48,981 --> 00:40:53,000
I think it's the woman
in black downstairs.

684
00:40:53,001 --> 00:40:55,881
I think it was her.

685
00:40:55,882 --> 00:40:59,732
What kind of a risk are we talking about
with her, if she doesn't listen to you?

686
00:40:59,733 --> 00:41:02,853
Well, she'd kill her.

687
00:41:03,382 --> 00:41:06,526
Darcy, it sounds like
we got here just in time.

688
00:41:06,527 --> 00:41:09,728
That's a lot to lay on
you guys in one night.

689
00:41:09,729 --> 00:41:12,031
What are you gonna do?

690
00:41:12,032 --> 00:41:14,972
We're gonna do it.

691
00:41:15,484 --> 00:41:17,308
We have nothing to lose.

692
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:19,551
You have everything to gain, actually.

693
00:41:19,552 --> 00:41:21,954
Gain your health back. Hopefully,
business will be better.

694
00:41:21,955 --> 00:41:25,780
I really care about Darcy's
business, as well as her well-being.

695
00:41:25,781 --> 00:41:31,681
So I'll do everything I can to make
sure that her business is successful.

696
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,211
I really hope Darcy follows my advice.

697
00:41:35,212 --> 00:41:39,285
This way, all the entities in her
restaurant will be able to move on.

698
00:41:39,286 --> 00:41:41,947
If she doesn't, I fear
not only for her safety,

699
00:41:41,948 --> 00:41:46,508
but her employees' and
customers', as well.
