Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,949
So much has happened here.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,293
I'm going through their
deaths... one, two, three, four.

4
00:00:11,294 --> 00:00:14,340
I didn't even know if I
was gonna live through it.

5
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:16,103
I could feel them touching.

6
00:00:16,104 --> 00:00:18,595
She was pushed down the stairs.

7
00:00:18,596 --> 00:00:20,740
It is an excruciating death.

8
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:22,688
- And they hung them.
- They hung them.

9
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,445
They're bent on revenge.

10
00:00:24,446 --> 00:00:25,946
Is it dangerous?

11
00:00:25,947 --> 00:00:29,549
You get bad people in a bad place.

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,090
Bad things are gonna happen.

13
00:00:34,222 --> 00:00:36,102
They're being watched.

14
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:39,010
My name is Amy Allan.

15
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:41,261
This thing likes death.

16
00:00:41,262 --> 00:00:43,044
I see dead people.

17
00:00:43,045 --> 00:00:44,612
This thing is, like, a monster.

18
00:00:44,613 --> 00:00:46,682
I speak to dead people.

19
00:00:46,683 --> 00:00:48,372
And he's pissed off now.

20
00:00:48,373 --> 00:00:49,881
And they speak to me.

21
00:00:49,882 --> 00:00:51,477
His head was cracked.

22
00:00:51,478 --> 00:00:54,457
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

23
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,507
This guy was murdered.

24
00:00:56,508 --> 00:00:57,926
I rely on my partner.

25
00:00:57,927 --> 00:00:59,330
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

26
00:00:59,331 --> 00:01:01,281
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

27
00:01:01,282 --> 00:01:03,999
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,092
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

29
00:01:07,093 --> 00:01:10,005
You saw her? It's my job to reveal them.

30
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:11,158
Why would you stay here?

31
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,282
But Steve and I never speak...

32
00:01:13,283 --> 00:01:15,266
We never communicate
during an investigation.

33
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:16,678
Until the very end.

34
00:01:16,679 --> 00:01:18,452
Stop it.

35
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,616
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

36
00:01:20,617 --> 00:01:23,022
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

37
00:01:23,023 --> 00:01:24,377
Or time to get out.

38
00:01:24,378 --> 00:01:29,058
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

39
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:52,468
Amy and I conduct our
investigations separately.

40
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:55,113
I interview witnesses, local experts,

41
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:59,141
and look for anything unusual
about the history of the location.

42
00:01:59,142 --> 00:02:03,587
At the end, we meet with our
clients to reveal our findings.

43
00:02:03,588 --> 00:02:06,798
I'm in downtown Seattle to
meet a woman named Darcy.

44
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,734
She was a big-time
skeptic of the paranormal.

45
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:11,570
Then she bought a restaurant.

46
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:16,494
Now she's seeing strange things, and she
thinks it's making her physically sick.

47
00:02:16,495 --> 00:02:20,078
She's afraid of losing her
business, her health, and her sanity.

48
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:24,399
Hopefully, Amy and I can help her out.

49
00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:32,832
Before Amy enters a location,

50
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:36,022
I clear it of anything that
could be leading information.

51
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:39,095
This restaurant has a lot of
photographs and historical items.

52
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:43,702
So it's important I take my
time to cover or remove them all.

53
00:02:43,703 --> 00:02:46,463
Once I'm done...

54
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:50,773
Amy can begin her walk.

55
...
...
...
676
00:40:25,979 --> 00:40:29,391
And there was no respect there.

677
00:40:29,392 --> 00:40:33,452
I would like them to
have a funeral service.

678
00:40:33,453 --> 00:40:35,640
Followed by a blessing.

679
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:39,999
So, if they get this funeral service
done, will this move these creatures on?

680
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,801
Well, it's part of the process.

681
00:40:41,802 --> 00:40:46,207
So, the funeral and then the blessing.
And that will help to move them on.

682
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:48,980
Who do you think made Darcy sick, then?

683
00:40:48,981 --> 00:40:53,000
I think it's the woman
in black downstairs.

684
00:40:53,001 --> 00:40:55,881
I think it was her.

685
00:40:55,882 --> 00:40:59,732
What kind of a risk are we talking about
with her, if she doesn't listen to you?

686
00:40:59,733 --> 00:41:02,853
Well, she'd kill her.

687
00:41:03,382 --> 00:41:06,526
Darcy, it sounds like
we got here just in time.

688
00:41:06,527 --> 00:41:09,728
That's a lot to lay on
you guys in one night.

689
00:41:09,729 --> 00:41:12,031
What are you gonna do?

690
00:41:12,032 --> 00:41:14,972
We're gonna do it.

691
00:41:15,484 --> 00:41:17,308
We have nothing to lose.

692
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:19,551
You have everything to gain, actually.

693
00:41:19,552 --> 00:41:21,954
Gain your health back. Hopefully,
business will be better.

694
00:41:21,955 --> 00:41:25,780
I really care about Darcy's
business, as well as her well-being.

695
00:41:25,781 --> 00:41:31,681
So I'll do everything I can to make
sure that her business is successful.

696
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,211
I really hope Darcy follows my advice.

697
00:41:35,212 --> 00:41:39,285
This way, all the entities in her
restaurant will be able to move on.

698
00:41:39,286 --> 00:41:41,947
If she doesn't, I fear
not only for her safety,

699
00:41:41,948 --> 00:41:46,508
but her employees' and
customers', as well.
